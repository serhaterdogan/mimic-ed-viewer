BiPAP

 
History of Present Illness:
The patient is an ___ yo woman with PMHx of ischemic stroke (~1 
month ago; presented with difficulty seeing on the left side per 
son), afib on ___, CHF, CAD and HTN who was transferred to 
___ after presenting to an OSH with falls and AMS with NCHCT 
revealing a R occipital lobe hypodensity with multifocal 
hyperdensities within it. History is primarily provided per 
rehab report and per telephone conversation with son as pt is 
unable to provide a history due to mental status.

Per rehab reports, pt has had increasing confusion, anxiety and 
paranoia over the past several days. She also fell 3 times in 
the past 4 days and had no injuries during each fall. She 
reportedly never hit her head. She had routine labs checked at 
the nursing facility earlier in the week which were unremarkable 
including a UA, CMP, coags, and CBC. 

She was brought to an OSH ED after having a repeat fall on day 
of admission. At the OSH, ___ raised concern for hemorrhagic 
transformation of pt's recent ischemic stroke. She was then 
transferred to ___ for further management.

At baseline, per son, pt lives with her son and gets assistance 
with ADLs. She reportedly has no other cognitive issues. 1 month 
prior, son reports pt was hospitalized with ""difficulty writing 
and seeing on the left side"" where she was diagnosed with an 
ischemic stroke. Son does not recall the etiology of the stroke 
or how long pt had been on ___ for.

Otherwise, pt has known O2 dependence due to COPD (on ___ at 
the nursing facility).

A reliable ROS is unable to be obtained as pt is disoriented and 
confused.

MICU ADMISSION NOTE
Please see Neurology and SICU notes for full details. In brief, 
this is an ___ with a history of ischemic stroke (approximately 
1 month prior to admission), afib previously on ___, sCHF 
(EF ___, COPD on home O2, HTN who presented from rehab with 
falls and worsening of baseline confusion. ___ revealed minor 
subacute hemorrhagic transformation of her known R occipital 
lobe hypodensity. She was initially monitored in the SICU and 
transferred to the Neurology floor service with stable repeat 
head imaging. She was switched from Xeralto to asa 81mg.  
 Her hospital course has been complicated by altered mental 
status felt by the neurology team to be secondary to sundowning. 
She has triggered for agitation on ___ and had been receiving 
Haldol initially. She had difficulty with sleep/wake cycle and 
was often very sleepy in the morning. She was started on 
Seroquel on ___ with dose increased to 25mg on ___. This did 
not seem to help her altered mental status.  
 She was given Lasix 20mg on ___ because of concern for volume 
overload in addition to her home Lasix 40mg. Her Cr increased 
from 1.5 to 2.3 that was attributed to increased Lasix.  
 On day of transfer, the patient triggered again for altered 
mental status. An ABG showed hypercarbia (___). Mental 
status was gradually improving over the course of the morning.  

On arrival to the MICU, she was observed by respiratory therapy 
to be on 4L O2 with SaO2 in the high ___. Given her chronic 
hypoxia on 2L home O2, her oxygen was decreased, her SaO2 
decreased to low ___ and mental status continued to improve.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is an ___ year old woman with recent history of 
ischemic stroke (~1 month ago), afib on ___, CHF, CAD, and 
HTN, who was transferred to ___ after presenting to an OSH 
from rehab on ___ ___nd AMS. Patient was evaluated 
one month ago for an ischemic stroke associated with difficulty 
writing and left-sided visual field cut. Since then, patient was 
noted in her skilled nursing facility to have had 3 falls in the 
4 days prior to admission. Patient was noted to not hit her 
head, and continuous labs were reportedly collected at the ___ 
and found to be unremarkable, including her CBC, coags, UA, and 
CMP. Due to her recent falls and altered mental status, patient 
presented in the ED at ___, where ___ 
showed R occipital hypodensity with multifocal hyperdensities 
within it. Concerned for a hemorrhagic transformation of 
patient's recent ischemic stroke, patient was transferred to 
___ for further management and work-up. Of note, her 
labs/studies on transfer were notable for INR 1.6, creatinine 
1.7, positive UA, and elevated LFTs.

In the ___ ER, patient's repeat INR was 2.6, and lactate was 
2.3 (repeat lactate was normal th following day, and the INR 
trended down). Patient reported CP 3 days prior to presentation, 
so was also evaluated with EKG which showed non-specific ST 
segment changes w/ first set of troponins being 0.09 (repeat 
troponin stable at 0.09 in setting of known CKD). Her SBP was in 
the 160s. Her neurological exam in the ER was notable for a left 
hemifield cut, inattention, and myoclonus, and repeat NCHCT was 
stable. MRI of the cervical spine showed kyphosis and 
anterlisthesis but no acute injury. 

She was admitted to the Neurology Stroke service for subacuate 
hemorrhagic transformation of her prior infarct. Of note, 
patient was found to be agitated at this time, reportedly 
hitting someone. She was given IM Haldol, making her quite 
somnolent the following day. On exam the morning after 
admission, she was alert, inattentive, following simple 
appendicular commands, and moving extremities without focality. 
When her mental clarity improved and she could cooperate with 
visual field testing, a dense left hemianopia was demonstrated. 
An. MRI was deferred due to the likely need for sedation.

Her lab work demonstrated an INR 1.7, negative urine, and serum 
tox, negative UA, mildly elevated AST, LDL 107, and HbA1c of 
7.4. Her HR was intermittently in the 130s-140s in AFib, and her 
home metoprolol was restarted. AMS with a large stroke raised 
the possibility of seizure, but her EEG did show any 
epileptiform activity. 

She was evaluated by ___, who felt that she represented a 
substantial fall risk. Her ___ was discontinued, and she was 
started on aspirin therapy for atrial fibrillation and ischemic 
stroke prevention. On ___, she attempted to walk without 
supervision, and she fell onto her bottom and hit her head on a 
bedside tray table. Her neurological exam at that time was 
stable, with the exception of increased confusion. She became 
progressively more agitated, pulling out her line and nasal 
cannula (on home ___. She required a posey vest and IM 
Haldol. A repeat head CT was stable. She was also started on 
nightly seroquel. 

Unfortonately her agitation and medical problems have been 
difficult to control.  She swings between uncontrollable 
agitation and oversedation in the AM especially.  She continues 
to have periodic elevated HRs, O2 NC needs (chronic, worsened 
CO2 retention), hypernatremia.   On ___ trigger due to AM 
somnolence, she has an ABG consistent with CO2 retention. She 
was transferred to the MICU, but did not require BiPap on 
transfer: her respiratory status improved with holding Seroquel 
as well as titrating O2 saturations in the low 90's.

MICU COURSE:

#Altered mental status:
Waxes and wanes, periods of somnolence with relatively normal 
ABGs so less clearly secondary to hypercarbia. Required mitts to 
prevent pulling lines. Patient had recent increase in thyroid 
medication from 100 to 150 at rehab, but TSH wnl. Outpt bicarb 
was 31. DDx for AMS included UTI as well given enterococcus in 
urine. She was treated for enterococcal UTI with ceftriazone 
___, switched to ampicillin ___, and was put on Bipap for Co2 
retention at night. Despite these interventions, AMS persisted. 
Neurology was consulted who suggested NCCTH and cvEEG. 
Non-contrast head CT showed no acute change, and EEG showed no 
evidence of seizures. They felt that her AMS may be associated 
with encephalopathy and delirium. Her AMS improved during 
admission, likely secondary treatment of UTI, and improved 
hypercarbia with BiPAP. Patient is being discharged to rehab 
with BiPAP to be used at night for hypercarbia at settings of 
___. 

# UTI: Urine growing Enterococcus (but < 100 k colonies) on 
___, repeat urine culture on ___ grew out > 100 K 
enterococcus. Patient was started on ceftriaxone on ___, 
switched to ampicillin ___ and completed a 10 day course for 
complicated UTI. 

# Acute on chronic Hypercarbia: pH and pCO2 improved with lower 
SaO2 and with CPAP overnight. Patient was initially kept on CPAP 
intermittently, later switched to Bipap overnight. Her ABGs 
demonstrated improvement in hypercarbia and patient's BiPAP 
requirements decreased. Settings on discharge were ___ with 
documented desaturations <88% for >5 minutes on continuous O2 
monitoring. Her hypercarbia most likely is in the setting of 
obesity hypoventilation that has been acutely worsened in the 
setting of her stroke as below.

# s/p R occipital lobe ischemic stroke with hemorrhagic
transformation with residual inattention and left homonymous 
hemianopsia. Hemorrhagic conversion likely occurred in setting 
of multiple recent falls and anticoagulation. Stable non-con 
head CTs since admission. Her home ___ was initially held in 
setting  of hemorrhagic transformation, but home aspirin and 
atorvastatin were continued. ___ was then restarted on 
discharge. 

# chronic systolic heart failure: ECHO ___ with  EF ___. 
pitting edema in lower extremities. Chest xray without pulmonary 
edema, rising Cr with dialysis, improved with 500cc bolus. Gave 
another 500 cc bolus on ___, cr improved to 2.0 from 2.2. Cr. 
Patient developed fluid overload while in the MICU likely in the 
setting of fluid boluses and was diuresed with IV Lasix. Once 
she approached euvolemia, her home Lasix 40mg BID was restarted. 


# paroxysmal afib: had been on rivaroxaban for anticoagulation, 
but falling a lot at home. metoprolol uptitrated for rate 
control. ___ was restarted on discharge. Aspirin and 
amiodarone were continued.  

# ___ on CKD: admission Cre 1.3, outpt baseline creatinine 1.6 
at outpt nephrologist office. Her Cr. increased in the setting 
of volume overload. She was diuresed to evuvolemia and her Cr. 
remained stable. Lisinopril was restarted due to hx of CHF. 
However Cr. increased to 2.0, and thus Lisinopril was 
discontinued. Please consider restarting Lisinopril when 
appropriate.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
====================
[ ] Patient was quite agitated and reportedly hit someone. 
Patient was given IM Haldol, while tramadol and mirtazapine were 
held as they can worsen the delirium. These have been restarted 
given improvement of encephalopathy.
[ ] HbA1c was also found to be 7.4%, and we recommend a repeat 
A1c to guide management.
[ ] LDL 107; please monitor lipids as outpatient
[ ] Patient's ___ was initially held in setting of bleed, 
and was restarted on discharge
[ ] will need repeat sleep study as outpatient 
[ ] chem7 3x weekly for hypernatremia and Cr
[ ] alendronate weekly 
[ ] nutrition thickened liquids and pureed mechanical 
[ ] redo MOLST given patient no longer ""Do Not Hospitalize""
[ ] recommend consulting palliative care
[ ] lisinopril held upon discharge; restart as Cr improves and 
BP tolerates
[ ] will likely need to be discharged on nocturnal BiPAP for 
management of her obesity hypoventilation

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were hospitalized due to a stroke, in which bleeding 
occurred in the back, right side of your brain, where you had a 
prior stroke a month ago. Sometimes, a stroke-induced injury to 
a part of the brain can weaken the blood vessels in the area, 
thereby predisposing that area to bleed. Furthermore, 
anticoagulation medication, such as ___, can prevent blood 
from clotting and thereby cause bleeding. We suspect that given 
your recent history of a stroke and anticoagulation use as well 
as your recent falls, you may have experienced such a scenario. 
Your CT scan and MRI imaging showed new bleeding in the same 
area of your prior stroke. For these reasons, you were admitted 
to the Neurology service at ___ for further evaluation and 
monitoring. 

You have an appointment to follow-up with Dr. ___ on ___ at 3:30 ___.

Because of concern for altered mental status, you were admitted 
to the ICU. Your mental status may have been diminished because 
of a urinary tract infection, being hospitalized, and because of 
increased carbon dioxide in your blood. You received a machine 
to help you breath at night which decreased the carbon dioxide 
in your blood. Your mental status has steadily improved. 

Thank you, and it was a pleasure to take part in your care.

Sincerely,
Your ___ Team

HPI: The patient is a ___ woman with a past medical
history of dementia who presents with confusion following a fall
(unclear etiology) with noncontrast head CT showing a right
intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the occipital lobe.  History is
provided with the assistance of patient's 3 grandchildren at
bedside.

Patient lives with her daughter and son-in-law.  She is able to
walk independently and occasionally uses a cane.  She needs
assistance with all of her activities of daily living including
getting dressed and showering.  She wears diapers and needs
assistance when she uses the bathroom.  She cannot cook or 
clean.
At baseline, she does not know the date.  She likes to watch TV.

On the day prior to presentation, she slid out of her recliner 
in
the evening.  She hit her buttock and did not hit her head. 
Overnight, her daughter awoke around 2:30 AM to hear a thud.  
She
found patient in her bedroom on the ground.  The room was
somewhat disorganized and the pictures on the nightstand were 
all
on the ground.  This had never happened before.  Patient is
unaware as to how she fell and she states that she might of
gotten up to use the bathroom.

Patient was initially brought to ___ where she was
found to have a urinary tract infection (she was given
ceftriaxone) and a noncontrast head CT showed a right occipital
lobe hemorrhage.  She was transferred to ___ for further
management.

At the time of my evaluation, patient reports a right-sided
headache that has now improved after receiving Tylenol.  She 
does
not know why she is in the hospital and has no other complaints.

Of note, patient reportedly also fell 1 week ago while walking 
in
the kitchen.  She slid and landed on her buttock at the time and
did not reportedly hit her head.

IMAGING: 

OSH CT ___, 10:45a): Right occipital lobe IPH. 
?layering with
hypodensity extending into the right occipital lobe.

MRI/A ___:
IMPRESSION: 
1. Grossly unchanged 29 x 19 mm acute right occipital 
intraparenchymal 
hemorrhage without definite underlying enhancing mass.  However, 
a prominent adjacent vessel is seen which could potentially 
represent draining veins in the setting of arteriovenous 
malformation, or possibly a developmental venous anomaly which 
could suggest an underlying cavernous malformation, though no 
definite nidus is seen, potentially effaced by the volume of 
hemorrhage.  Alternatively, given the scattered areas of 
subcortical chronic microhemorrhage, cerebral amyloid is 
considered a reasonable explanation for the cause of bleed.  In 
this case, the surrounding prominent vascularity may be due to 
reactive hyperemia. 
2. Additional 20 x 18 mm right posterior temporal subacute 
intraparenchymal hemorrhage without definite underlying 
enhancing lesion or vascular malformation seen. 
3. Small right temporal subacute subdural hematoma measuring up 
to 6 mm in 
maximal thickness, not well seen on the prior CT examination. 
4. Mild narrowing of the P1 and P 2 segments of the bilateral 
posterior 
cerebral arteries and distal M1 segment of the right middle 
cerebral artery, likely atherosclerotic. 
5. 7 x 3 mm posteriorly directed extradural aneurysm of the 
petrous segment of the left internal carotid artery. 
6. Otherwise patent intracranial arterial vasculature without 
high-grade 
stenosis or occlusion. 
7. Mild global atrophy and confluent areas of white matter 
signal abnormality in a configuration most suggestive of chronic 
small vessel ischemic disease. 
8. Mild paranasal sinus mucosal wall thickening and bilateral 
mastoid air cell opacification, nonspecific, which can be seen 
in the setting of acute 
sinusitis given the appropriate clinical context. 
  
RECOMMENDATION(S):  Continued follow-up examinations with 
gadolinium enhanced MRI to resolution of hemorrhage is 
recommended in order to definitively exclude an underlying mass 
or vascular malformation. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is an ___ woman with a past medical history of 
dementia who presented with confusion following a fall (unclear 
etiology) with noncontrast head CT showing a right 
intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the occipital lobe. Examination 
was notable for a left homonymous hemianopsia and baseline 
mental status deficits. There was no evidence of significant 
trauma; OSH lumbar spine CT showed degenerative disease but no 
fracture per Neuroradiology. 

Etiology of bleed was most likely amyloid angiopathy in the 
setting of underlying dementia, less likely underlying mass 
lesion or hemorrhagic conversion of a prior ischemic infarct, or 
AVM/cavernoma. There was no evidence of expansion of the bleed 
on repeat imaging.  Would consider repeat imaging in ___ months 
to re-evaluate for an underlying lesion after hemorrhage 
resolves.  Aspirin and all anticoagulation was held in the 
setting of the bleed. She should continue to avoid these 
medications; can use limited NSAIDs in ___ weeks. She was 
treated with ceftriaxone for 3 days for a presumed UTI (final 
culture negative). She remained afebrile with stable vital 
signs. She had some urinary retention in addition to 
incontinence for which she was straight catheterized, this 
should be continued to be followed closely. Repeat UA was 
negative thus infection was not thought to be the cause of this 
incontinence and retention. She will be discharged to rehab 
where she will continue to work with ___ and OT.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were hospitalized due to symptoms of confusion after a fall 
resulting from an ACUTE HEMORRHAGIC STROKE, which is bleeding in 
the brain.  

The brain is the part of your body that controls and directs all 
the other parts of your body, so damage to the brain can result 
in a variety of symptoms.  Stroke can have many different 
causes, so we assessed you for medical conditions that might 
raise your risk of having stroke. In order to prevent future 
strokes, we plan to modify those risk factors.

We are changing your medications as follows:
STOP Aspirin.
Avoids NSAIDs for the next ___ weeks

Please take your other medications as prescribed.

Please follow-up with Neurology and your primary care physician.
If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:

- Sudden partial or complete loss of vision
- Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth
- Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you
- Sudden weakness of one side of the body
- Sudden drooping of one side of the face
- Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body

Sincerely,
Your ___ Neurology Team

Brief Hospital Course:
 ___ year old female admitted to the hospital after a mechanical 
fall from standing. There reportedly was no loss of 
consciousness.  She sustained a C2 lamina fracture,left humeral 
head fracture (acute on chronic), left ___ rib fractures,non 
displaced, and a pubic rami fracture.  The patient was made NPO 
upon admission and underwent imaging. 

 Because of her injuries, she was evalutated by the Ortho-Spine 
service for a minimally displaced bilateral laminae fractures of 
C2.  She had a normal neurologic examination.  Based on these 
findings, this injury was treated conservatively with cervical 
collar immobilization for 2 weeks and a follow-up visit. The 
Orthopedic service was consulted for pelvic and humeral 
fracture. They determined that the patient had an old proximal 
humerus fracture and a non-displaced verticle rim patella 
fracture. Neither injury required surgical repair and both were 
treated in a non-operative manner. The left shoulder injury was 
managed in a sling for comfort with advance ROM and AROM as 
tolerated.
The patella was not braced as the patient was not having pain 
with active
extension.  The patient's rib pain and other bony injuries were 
managed with oral analgesia.  She was instructed in the use of 
the incentive spirometer.  

During her hospital course, the patient's vital signs were 
stable and she was afebrile.  Her pain was controlled with oral 
analgesia.  She was tolerating a regular diet and voiding 
without difficulty.  She remained in a soft cervical collar for 
neck immobilization. The patient was seen by physical therapy 
and recommendations were made for discharge to a rehabilitation 
facility.

 The patient was discharged on HD # 3 in stable condition.  
Appointments for follow-up were made with the Spine, Orthopedic 
and acute care service.  The patient will also need follow-up 
with her primary care provider for findings on cat scan of 
biliary dilitation and the need for MRCP/ERCP.  Dr. ___ 
patient's primary care provider, was informed of the need for 
additional imaging.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the orthopedic surgery service and 
was taken to the operating room for above described procedure. 
Please see separately dictated operative report for details. The 
surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the 
procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.

Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:
Overnight on POD#0, the patient's urine output was downtrending. 
 She was given a 1 liter bolus of fluid with appropriate 
response.  Her potassium then increased to 5.6.  Calcium and 
insulin were given.  EKG was unchanged.  Her fluids were changed 
to normal saline.  Patient had some difficulty with word 
finding.  Neuro exam intact.  Her narcotics were changed from 
Oxycodone to Tramadol.  On POD#1, the patient continued to have 
difficulty with word finding.  Neurology was consulted and 
recommended a CT of the head.  The CT showed significant 
atrophy, which was unchanged from previous CT.  Neurology 
believed it was delirium.  An infectious was performed, which 
was negative.  She was kept on the Tramadol; however, she was 
eventually placed on low-dose Oxycodone for better pain control. 
 Geriatrics was also consulted to assist in co-management of the 
patient.  On POD#2, her infectious work-up continued to be 
negative.  Her sodium was also low (129-130) post-operatively.  
Geriatrics believed it was due to her Prozac.  The dosage of 
this medication was decreased during her admission with plans to 
discontinue it post-taper.  On POD#3, her hematocrit was 20.3 
and she was transfused with 2 units of blood.  She also 
complained of chest pain/tightness.  An EKG was performed and 
showed no change from previous EKGs.  Cardiac enzymes were 
drawn, which were negative.  On POD#4, an incisional wound vac 
was placed for incisional drainage.  It was removed on POD#5.  
She was kept for two additional days until her drainage had 
decreased.

Otherwise, the patient received Lovenox for DVT prophylaxis 
starting on the morning of POD#1.  The foley was removed and the 
patient was voiding independently thereafter. The surgical 
dressing was changed and the Silverlon dressing was removed on 
POD#2. The surgical incision was found to be clean and intact 
without erythema or abnormal drainage. The patient was seen 
daily by physical therapy. Labs were checked throughout the 
hospital course and repleted accordingly. At the time of 
discharge the patient was tolerating a regular diet and feeling 
well.  The patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.  The 
patient's hematocrit was acceptable and pain was adequately 
controlled on an oral regimen. The operative extremity was 
neurovascularly intact and the wound was benign. 

The patient's weight-bearing status is touch down weight bearing 
on the operative extremity with posterior precautions. She 
should remain in her abduction brace at all times, locked at 30 
degrees of abduction, ___ degrees of hip flexion. Walker or two 
crutches at all times for 6 weeks.
 
Ms ___ is discharged to rehab in stable condition.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ pleasant year old female s/p recent left hip revision 
hemiarthoplasty presents from nursing home with mechanical fall, 
found to have profound hyponatremia (118) and likely UTI, and 
___. It was determined patient likely had prerenal ___ prior to 
admission, and during hospital stay while hyponatremika improved 
from 118 to 128 source of hypoantremia remained unclear, with 
belief being patient may have suffered from SIADH vs reset 
osmostat. Patient discharged on 1 L fluid restriction with plans 
for close PCP followup, and her home SSRi was stopped.  

HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE
==================
#Hyponatremia: Likely chronic in setting of poor po intake, 
possible volume down, and confusion from UTI. initially patient 
was fluid restricted for concern siadh. Patient was given 500 cc 
boluses but now with ___ improvement 118 on admission to 129, 
leading team to believe hypovolemic hyponatremia in setting of 
poor po intake after recent hip surgery as cause. However, 
patient then subseqeutnly had drop in ___, with urine osmolality 
showed ~ 400. AS a result, patient was fluid restricted, with ___ 
hovering around ~140, with resolution ___ below. Ultimately it 
was determined as despite fluid boluses and fluid restriction 
and given lack of symptoms, patient may have had a reset 
osmostat as well. Her home fluoxetine was stopped, and TSH was 
checked at 12 (FT4 1.0); home synthroid was uptitrated to 75 mcg 
from 50mcg as a result.   

# UTI, leukocytosis: CXR clear. WBC 13.4 on admision, ~ 7 on 
___ after treating uti. Patient was on bactrim ___t 
___ for unclear reason, switched to cipro in house. patient 
afebrile, has some hesitancy symptoms, mild positive u/a. 
Leukocytosis now improving. Urince cultures were negative but 
given fact patient came in on bactrim and improvement in WBC 
continued cipro /17, d7 = ___ given improvement since starting 
antibx

___: Cr 1.4 from 1.0 baseline, likely pre renal. It was 
believed she ahd a prerenal ATN immediately prior to admission 
as while giving her fluidis initially during her stay helped her 
___ it worsened her Cr. However, by discharge, Cr had started to 
downtrend to 1.2. 

# Hypertension: Home lisinopril was held due to ___ above. She 
was intermittently hypertensive overnight in the setting of 
pain. She recieved oxycodone prn as below.  

#Trauma workup s/p mechanical fall: Hip x-rays Negative, no 
fractures. Patient s/o ___ left hip hemiarthoplasty (left 
hip s/p hip replacement ___ years prior) Pain control with 
oxycodone. 

# Hx depression: Continued hoem fluoxetine, then stopped ___ 
possible SIADH above 

# Hypothyroid: Continued home synthroid. TSH in house was 12; 
however free T4 was wnl. ___ hypothyroidism as possible 
etiology of hypoantremia above, patient was uptitrated to 75 mcg 
synthroid on d/c. 

# Osteoporosis: Continued calcium, vitamin D 

# Pain control: Continued home meds save for hydromorphone; 
switched to oxycodone prn, can switch back on d/c. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
==============================
-Patient to end ciprofloxacin on ___
-Please check ___, Cr at next PCP appointment, ___ on d/c 128, 
1.2
-Patient used short term oxycodone in house; she can resume her 
prior pain regimen thereafter. Rx short course to last until PCP 
followup as patient feared ALF would require rx to fill.  
-Patient's home lisinopril discontinued, if Cr returns to normal 
on d/c woul restart
-Home synthroid increased to 75 mcg from 50 mcg given TSH of 12 
(elevated) and hyponatremia above (however free T4 1). Given 
just subclinical hypothyroidism on labs; would recheck TSH and 
Free T4 in 3 weeks; if patient hyperthyroid decrease synthroid 
back to 50 mcg. 
-Patient's home SSRI stopped due to hyponatremia above. 
-Patient discharged on 1 L fluid restriction; if patient appears 
dry on F/U appointment and ___ improving, would liberalize 
restriction.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old female admitted to the hospital after a mechanical 
fall in which she sustained right sided ___ rib fractures and a 
small right pneumothorax. She was transferred here for medical 
management.  Upon admission, the patient was made NPO, given 
intravenous fluids, and underwent imaging.  Cat scan imaging of 
the head and c-spine showed no acute fractures.  Additional 
imaging of the chest and pelvis showed a small right apical 
pneumothorax, 13x8 mm nodule left lower lobe and a 0.7 cm lesion 
in left hepatic lobe.  These findings will need further 
investigation.  

During the patient's hospitalization, her vital signs remained 
stable and she was afebrile.  She was instructed in the use of 
the incentive spirometer. Her rib pain was controlled with oral 
analgesia. She was tolerating a regular diet and voiding without 
difficulty.  She was evaluated by physical therapy and 
recommendations made for discharge to a rehabilitation facility. 
 The patient was discharged on HD #5 in stable condition.

Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker 
or cane).

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital after a fall in which you 
sustained right sided rib fractures and a small collapse of your 
right lung.  Your vital signs have been stable and you are 
preparing for discharge to a rehabilitation center to help 
further regain your strength and mobility.  You are being 
discharged with the following instructions: 

   Your injury caused right sided_rib fractures which can cause 
severe pain and subsequently cause you to take shallow breaths 
because of the pain.
 
*  You should take your pain medication as directed to stay 
ahead of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep 
breaths. If the pain medication is too sedating take half the 
dose and notify your physician.
 
*  Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures.  In order to 
decrease your risk you must use your incentive spirometer 4 
times every hour while awake.  This will help expand the small 
airways in your lungs and assist in coughing up secretions that 
pool in the lungs.
 
*  You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to 
hold against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing 
and deep breathing.
 
*  Symptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short 
periods may ease the pain.
 
*  Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you 
should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid 
and fiber intake if possible.
 
*  Do NOT smoke
 
*  If your doctor allows, non steroidal ___ drugs 
are very effective in controlling pain ( ie, Ibuprofen, Motrin, 
Advil, Aleve, Naprosyn) but they have their own set of side 
effects so make sure your doctor approves.
 
*  Return to the Emergency Room right away for any acute 
shortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation 
around your ribs ( crepitus ). 

In addition to the rib fracture recommendations, I have included 
the following instructions:

You experience new chest pain, pressure, squeezing or tightness.

*New or worsening cough, shortness of breath, or wheeze.

*If you are vomiting and cannot keep down fluids or your 
medications.

*You are getting dehydrated due to continued vomiting, diarrhea, 
or other reasons. Signs of dehydration include dry mouth, rapid 
heartbeat, or feeling dizzy or faint when standing.

*You see blood or dark/black material when you vomit or have a 
bowel movement.

*You experience burning when you urinate, have blood in your 
urine, or experience a discharge.

*You have shaking chills, or fever greater than 101.5 degrees 
Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius.

*Any change in your symptoms, or any new symptoms that concern

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was taken to operating room on ___ for a total 
shoulder arthroplasty. She lost 1.5L of blood and recieved 2 
units intraoperative. Here pressures were maintained on 
neosynephrein until it was weaned in the PACU with stable BP and 
a HCT of 36.

On POD 1 her drain output was 30cc so it was dc'd. Her pain was 
controlled and she was NVI.  HCT 22 -> transfuse 2u PRBCs.  
Subsequently her HCT was stable at 26.3.  She required no 
further transfusions and was hemodynamically stable upone 
discharge.

Otherwise, she was voiding on her own and tolerating a regular 
diet.

back pain along with cervical radiculopathy and polyneuropathy 
who presents to the ED s/p fall and found to have subdural 
hematoma measuring 11mm x 6mm that appears to be ___ fatigue, 
poor PO, and potentially deliriogenic medications.

# Subdural Hematoma: 
Small right frontal subdural hematoma on admission CT head with 
negative CT c-spine. No neurosurgical interventions or repeat 
imaging needed per Neurosurgery in ED. Patient also needs no NSG 
followup as per the team. Her course remained stable, with no 
changes in her neurological function which would have been 
indicative of progression of the subdural hematoma. The 
neurosurgery service was consulted on ___ in regards to 
whether or not patient can be anticoagulated with DVT 
prophylaxis - they recommended holding ASA x 1 week from 
___ (to ___. After ___, aspirin can be 
started if recommended by patient's primary care physician for

appointment schedule. ___ evaluated and recommends short term 
rehab. In evaluation of the medication list - patient is on a 
number of deliriogenic medications and doses that are above the 
recommended level including Lorazepam 1 mg PO BID for anxiety, 
which can increase risk of delirium/falls. She is on Trazodone 
100mg PO qHS:prn for insomnia, which increased risk for QT 
prolongation and for somnolence that may contribute to the 
overnight risk of falls. In addition, she is on standing 
narcotics for her chronic pain, and these may also contribute to 
fall risk. Prior to discharge from ___ a workup for other 
causes of patient's fall were performed. EKG indicated ___ 
degree AV block, but otherwise was within normal limits. In 
addition, electrolytes were within normal limits. Her gait was 
unstable at times, prompting physical therapy to recommend that 
the patient go to short term rehab.

# CKD: 
Creatinine of 1.2, at baseline and stable. Patient notes that 
she has a history of one of her kidneys not being appropriately 
formed and that this is the cause of her CKD. Medications were 
renally dosed, and nephrotoxic agents were avoided. Kidney 
function monitored throughout hospitalization.

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. ___, 

You came to ___ after having a 
fall, hitting your head and sustaining a subdural hematoma (a 
small area of bleeding in your brain). You were seen by the 
neurosurgery service which found that the area of bleeding was 
small, should not affect your activities, and does not require 
any follow up with neurosurgery. Because you sustained an injury 
to your forehead, you received stitches and will need to go to 
the plastic surgery clinic at ___ on either ___ to 
have these removed, and for re-evaluation of your head wound. We 
found that the most likely cause of your fall was fatigue from 
your numerous doctor's appointments, and not eating and drinking 
enough. In addition, some of your home medications can 
contribute to falls. 

You were seen by our physical therapists who recommended you go 
to a rehab facility to regain your strength before returning to 
assisted living. 

It has been a pleasure caring for you here at ___, and we wish 
you all the best.

CXR ___ IMPRESSION:  
No acute cardiopulmonary process. 

EEG RESULTS ___ IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous 
ICU monitoring study because (1) rare isolated sharp transient 
in the left temporal region, suggestive of an area of cortical 
irritability; (2) excessive theta activity during wakefulness, 
suggestive of a mild encephalopathy. There are no electrographic 
seizures. 

US LIVER/GALLBLADDER ___ IMPRESSION: 
1. Cirrhotic liver, without evidence of focal lesion, 
splenomegaly, or ascites. 
2. Cholelithiasis and ___ile duct.  Correlate with 
LFTs.  If additional evaluation is required, MRCP can be 
performed. 

EEG RESULTS ___ IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous 
ICU EEG monitoring study because of a poorly modulated slightly 
slower than normal background consistent with a mild 
encephalopathy. Infrequent left anterior temporal sharp and slow 
wave epileptiform discharges were also seen in drowsiness. These 
were not repetitive nor rhythmic, and may be consistent with a 
focal area of potential epileptogenesis. No electrographic 
seizures were seen. 

EEG ___ IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU EEG 
monitoring study because of a slower than normal background 
consistent with a mild encephalopathy. Focal left temporal 
discharges were also identified; these were not repetitive nor 
rhythmic but could represent a potential area of 
epileptogenesis. No ongoing seizures were identified. Compared 
to the prior day's recording, there are no significant changes. 
Findings were provided to the treating team intermittently 
during this recording period. 

MRI BRAIN SEIZURE PROTOCOL ___ IMPRESSION: 
1.  Study is mildly degraded by motion. 
2.  Within limits of study, no evidence of intracranial mass. 
3. Age advanced prominence of the ventricles and sulci, may be 
sequelae of patient's chronic alcohol use. 
4. White matter lesion as described.  While findings are likely 
microangiopathic changes, differential considerations include 
sequela of prior trauma or infection, history of migraine 
headaches, inflammatory or 
demyelinating process.  If concern for active demyelinating 
process, consider contrast enhanced brain MRI for further 
evaluation. 
5. Nonspecific bilateral hippocampal formation atrophy as 
described. 
6.  Paranasal sinus disease as described. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o M with PMH ETOH abuse (drinking 1 pint vodka daily), 
unspecified seizure disorder, presented to OSH ED for evaluation 
following a seizure. Patient states he has had ___ seizure 
episodes daily. Sometimes episodes are staring off into space, 
others are local jerking of his arms or legs. On Keppra, 
Oxcarbazepine, Lacosamide for anti-epleptics, although reports 
that he is not taking Lacosamide. He was transferred to ___ 
for EEG monitoring. Neurology was consulted and recommended 
continuous EEG monitoring, MRI brain, which were both 
unrevealing. Patient did have 3 episodes of witnessed seizure 
activity while inpatient. Once was staring off into space x 
___ sec and once was witnessed by nursing and residents as ___ 
min of bilateral lower extremity jerking without LOC. Patient 
also had 1 generalized seizure >3min on ___ requiring 2mg Ativan 
IV to break the seizure. Patient was also placed on CIWA 
protocol given h/o ETOH use. Last drink was day of admission to 
hospital. Patient maximum CIWA score was 4, and he did not 
received any benzodiazepines. He was discharged to follow up 
final neurology results of EEG with the ___ Seizure Clinic. 
Patient was also encouraged to stop drinking. While inpatient, 
given his ETOH, a liver ultrasound was performed showing 
evidence of cirrhosis. Since patient not acutely 
encephalopathic, deferred work up for outpatient setting. 

# SEIZURE DISORDER, UNSPECIFIED: Patient has known history of 
unspecified seizure disorder. He reports history of grand mal 
seizures as a child. He currently has multiple seizures a day 
that last anywhere from 10 seconds to 5 min. Sometimes episodes 
are staring off into space versus isolated jerking in 
extremities. Of note, patient has no history of ETOH withdrawal 
seizures and did not score CIWAs high enough to require 
benzodiazepines during this admission, although patient 
understood ETOH use likely lowers his seizure threshold. On 
admission, patient was evaluated by the neurology team who 
recommended spot EEG testing and continuation of home 
antiepileptic regimen. Throughout the admission, patient was 
placed on seizure precautions and followed by neurology. He had 
multiple episodes of possible witness seizures including an 
episode of gazing off into space, a partial seizure with 
isolated bilateral lower extremity jerking that resolved without 
Ativan after ___ minutes. On ___ patient had a generalized 
seizure with some tonic/clonic movements, unresponsiveness that 
lasted >3 minutes and required 2mg IV Ativan to break the 
seizure. Patient received continuous EEG monitoring as well as 
an MRI brain seizure protocol to evaluate for possible 
etiologies of his seizures. MRI was consistent with no 
intracranial masses, positive atrophy consistent with ETOH 
abuse, but otherwise no other convincing findings for seizure. 
EEG showed abnormalities but also was difficult to determine 
underlying cause for seizures. Neurology team recommended 
outpatient follow up with their seizure clinic since patient has 
been lost to follow up. At discharge he was continued on his 
home dose of levatiraetam, oxcarbazepine. Lacosamide was 
discontinued since patient reported not taking this medication 
for many months prior to admission.  
 
 # ETOH ABUSE: Patient has known history of ETOH abuse, 
currently drinks 1 pint of vodka daily. His sister is very 
concerned about the patient's safety and is interested in 
pursuing section 35 of the patient for ___ rehab. However, 
this was unable to be obtained while patient was admitted to the 
hospital. Patient's last drink was on day of admission. His ETOH 
level was >200. Patient denied history of ETOH withdrawal. He 
was placed on CIWA protocol with PRN diazepam. He was also given 
IV thiamine, oral MVI and folate. Social work was consulted who 
repeatedly discussed ETOH abuse with the patient. Patient 
declined day programs and ___ rehab. Patient maximum CIWA 
score was 4 on hospital day 1 due to tremors and anxiety, but 
quickly CIWAs decreased to 1. Patient did not require 
benzodiazepines while inpatient.  

 #?Cirrhosis: Given h/o ETOH abuse and concern for developing 
liver disease with noted asterixis/hand tremor early in 
admission, liver ultrasound was obtained that was consistent 
with cirrhosis. LFTs showed mildly elevated AST and T bili but 
were otherwise unremarkable. Hepatitis serologies were negative 
for HBV, HCV. Recommend outpatient follow up for further work-up 
of ETOH cirrhosis and treatment.

=====================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:

#ETOH Abuse: Denied rehab/day programs offered by social work 
multiple times. 
#Cirrhosis: Will need outpatient work-up of cirrhosis following

There, he was found down and unresponsive.  ___ then 
witnessed
him have a GTC that lasted ___ minutes.  EMS was called.  BG was
WNL.  He was taken to OSH, where he was witnessed to have 2
reportedly generalized seizure by EMS (referred to in ED
documentation).  He appears to have received Ativan 2mg x2 for
this.

He remained unresponsive and was eventually intubated for ? NCSE
and AMS with etomidate and propofol.  Following this, his

the past, and his sister tells he he has been hospitalized at
least once for status epilepticus.  At his most recently
Neurology visit, his Keppra was increased to 2g BID (trileptal
dose remained the stable).  He was to be evaluated for a VNS.

Additionally, he has had several recent admission to ___ 
in

IMAGING EVALUATION:

NCHCT: no acute intracranial process.  Involution changes and
subtle microvascular angiopathy stable from ___

CT C-spine: No cervical vertebral fracture or traumatic
subluxation. Multilevel degenerative changes as detailed.

EEg ___
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured a single pushbutton 
activation, showing no 
evidence of epileptiform activity or seizure at the time. The 
rest of the 
record showed a slow background with bursts of generalized 
slowing, indicating 
widespread encephalopathy. Medications, metabolic disturbances, 
and infection 
are among the most common causes. There were no areas of 
prominent focal 
slowing. The background appeared to improve somewhat over the 
course of the 
recording. There were several isolated left frontotemporal sharp 
and slow wave 
discharges but no repetitive discharges or electrographic 
seizures.. 

EEG ___
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations. 
It showed a 
single left anterior quadrant sharp and slow wave discharge, 
without 
repetition. Otherwise, it showed a normal background from 
wakefulness or 
drowsiness. There were no other epileptiform features or any 
electrographic 
seizures. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr ___ ___ (EU ___  ___ is a ___ 
male with a past medical history of EtOH abuse (current reported 
abstinence), epilepsy on keppra and oxcarb who presents as a 
transfer for ? status in setting of poor enteral absorption due 
to  GI illness as well as hyponatremia.

# Neurologic
Seizures: patient was admitted to neuro ICU for multiple 
seizures witnessed by EMS. He arrived intubated after starting 
on versed and received etomidate. cvEEG was started and showed 
no active seizures; he had diffuse slow activity and left 
temporal sharp discharges. Etiology of breakthrough seizures 
suspected to be a combination of poor enteral absorption in 
setting of GI illness as well as hyponatremia. He denied 
medication noncompliance or alcohol relapse, and tox screen was 
negative for serum EtOH. Keppra and trileptal levels sent on 
admission. He was continued on his home keppra 2000mg BID and 
trileptal 900mg BID. Of note, ___ records indicate that 
his family was reporting daily ""staring episodes"" for which his 
outpatient provider ___ been ___ his keppra 
and considering VNS.

Encephalopathy: he was found to be alert and following commands, 
and subsequently extubated on day 1 of admission. On 
re-evaluation after extubation, he was notably confused, 
disoriented, and encephalopathic, with mild asterixis, but able 
to follow commands and without any focality. On discussion with 
his sister he has had a longstanding history of memory problems, 
and is assisted in his ADLs by his girlfriend ___, but 
appears to be far from his baseline. His toxometabolic workup 
included ammonia which was normal; etiology suspected to be 
multifactorial, with factors including recent administration of 
sedating medications, several seizures, and hyponatremia, 
requiring a prolonged period of recovery in a patient with 
chronic cerebral atrophy and limited reserve. He was also 
started on high dose IV thiamine x3 days.

# Renal
Na was 127 on arrival, suspected ___ volume loss from recent 
vomiting/GI illness. He had fluid resuscitation and was briefly 
started on salt tabs. After receiving fluids, this improved to 
137 and salt tabs were discontinued. On review of records, it 
appears that his baseline Na is between low 130s-140. Of note, 
prior to transfer from ICU he did have increased urine output, 
which improved throughout admission.

# MSK
ACS was consulted for a tertiary survey post-trauma. He had CT 
c-spine at OSH which did not show any acute fractures. He was 
cleared by ACS.

#Leukopenia
Patient was noted to be leukopenic with absolute lymphocyte 
count of 0.76. This was thought to be due to recent viral 
illness and improved throughout hospitalization. HIV was sent 
and was negative. He should have a repeat CBC with differential 
in 1 week (___).

He was seen by ___ who recommended rehab. He was discharged in 
stable condition. 
Anticipated length of stay less than 30 days. 

Transitional issues:
-Repeat CBC with differential in 1 week (___)
-Neurology follow up

Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted after having a seizure at home. Since you 
report that you take your seizure medication regularly and you 
are not drinking alcohol, it is unclear what precipitated this 
breakthrough seizure. You were monitored on EEG, which showed no 
seizures. You were continued on your home seizure medications 
unchanged. You were started on additional vitamins, which you 
should continue taking at home. You returned to your baseline 
and were discharged to rehab facilty.

It was a pleasure caring for you.

___ 06:51AM BLOOD Lactate-1.___ year old man with a history of seizure disorder (on phenytoin 
and Levetiracetam) and alcohol use disorder (c/b alcohol 
withdrawal seizures), he presented with seizures s/p fall with 
headstrike and also found to have small parafalcine SDH in the 
setting of nonadherence to his medications and heavy drinking 
per his girlfriend. ___ of breakthrough seizures likely 
medication nonadherence and alcohol withdrawal. There were no 
signs of infection. He was intubated for airway protection after 
having several seizures in the emergency department. He was 
transfused platelets as he was noted to be thrombocytopenic 
(though this appears chronic). His 7mm parafalcine SDH was felt 
most likely to be traumatic in nature. This was stable on 
subsequent head CT. He was loaded with fosphenytoin, 
Levetiracetam, and phenobarbital in the emergency department. 
Fosphenytoin was not continued due to thrombocytopenia, as this 
had been noted to have worsened as an outpatient when he was 
switched from oxcarbazepine to phenytoin. Phenobarbital taper 
was continued per protocol. His cvEEG showed occasional L sided 
epileptiform discharges but no further seizures and EEG was 
discontinued. He self extubated on hospital day 2. Was cleared 
for a regular diet. Became very agitated, code purple called 
multiple times in the next ___ hours. Received ~25 mg Haldol for 
one code purple with some effect, additional 25 during another 
code purple with some effect. Precedex drip appeared to work 
well. Attempted to wean off precedex to clonidine, but again 
became agitated. Started on standing Haldol. Became agitated 
again and was reintubated. He was given a rescue dose of 
phenobarb 2.5 mg/kg and continued on taper. Seroquel 50 q8h was 
started. He was extubated ___. Psychiatry was consulted for 
agitation management. His Seroquel was increased to 150 mg q8h, 
Precedex was continued, Ativan was given PRN. Phenobarb taper 
discontinued as Ativan was started. QTc was monitored. Changed 
from keppra to valproate for seizure disorder, to see if it 
would be helpful from a mood stabilization perspective as well. 

Following the above changes, Mr. ___ was again successfully 
extubated, with scheduled doses of quetiapine and lorazepam used 
for agitation management. His dexmedetomidine infusion was 
weaned on this regimen, and lorazepam was switched to as-needed 
haloperidol due to concern for residual toxic-metabolic 
encephalopathy rather than ongoing alcohol withdrawal. A repeat 
24-hour period of cvEEG did not reveal seizures. He was 
stabilized on an oral regimen prior to transfer out of the ICU.

Once on the floor, his agitation remained very well controlled. 
His Seroquel was weaned and stopped prior to discharge. 

On the morning of ___, at approximately 8:10am he had an episode 
of speech arrest with stiffness and unresponsiveness for about 
10 minutes. This was felt to likely be another seizure. As he 
was only on monotherapy at this point, the decision was made to 
restart Keppra, at his home dose of 1500mg BID. Finally, given 
the possibility of hepatotoxicity (especially given his alcohol 
use), the decision was made to switch Depakote to Lacosamide. 
This was started at a dose of 50mg BID and was titrated up to 
150mg BID prior to discharge. He will increase to a final dose 
of 200mg BID.

Regarding his alcohol use, Psychiatry discussed the possibility 
of Naltrexone to reduce alcohol cravings. He was agreeable. 
Naltrexone was started at 25mg daily, and increased to 50mg 
daily prior to discharge. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
-Plan for Depakote wean: Take 250mg twice per day for one more 
day (through ___.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___ 
___.

You were in the hospital after you had a seizure at home. We 
think this seizure may have been caused by missing your 
medications, or from alcohol withdrawal.

In the hospital, we gave you medications to control the symptoms 
of your alcohol withdrawal. You did not clearly have any more 
seizures, although you did have an episode of staring off, which 
may have been a seizure. We also made some changes to your 
seizure medicines. We hope these will give you better control 
over your seizures. 

When you leave the hospital, it is very important for you to 
take your medicines every day without missing any doses. This 
will help keep you from having seizures. According to 
___ law, you cannot drive for 6 months from you 
last seizure. You should also avoid heights, ladders, operating 
heavy machinery, or bathing/swimming unsupervised.

Please continue to adjust your medicines as follows:
-Depakote: Take 250mg twice per day for one more day (through 
___.
Then take 100mg twice per day for two days (___).
Then STOP.
-Lacosamide: Take 150mg twice per day for one more day (through 
___.
Then increase to 200mg twice per day (starting ___. 
Continue taking this dose.

Best wishes,
Your ___ team

IMAGING
========
CT done at OSH no additional imaging done this hospitalization 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ male with history of childhood 
epilepsy, chronic alcohol abuse complicated by alcohol 
withdrawal seizures, seizure disorder on Vimpat/Keppra, who 
initially presented to ___ after seizure post drinking, 
there had another witnessed seizure, status post phenobarbital 
loading there, transferred to ___ for further management. 
Initially admitted to ___ given concern for withdrawal 
seizures.

#Seizure - History of chronic EtOH abuse c/b withdrawal, and 
seizure disorder on keppra/vimpat, presenting with reported 
witnessed seizure at home after drinking and an additional 
3-minute generalized tonic-clonic seizure at ___. S/p 
phenobarb load there also requiring 4mg Ativan. I suspect that 
this is less likely related to withdrawal seizure given reported 
recent history of drinking and positive EtOH level at OSH. Given 
history of nonadherence to AEDs, seizure possibly in this 
context. Patient was restarted on home AEDs and eventually 
transferred to the neurology service for further management. He 
was continued on home AEDs without recurrence of seizures. 
Levels were checked and Vimpat level was 2.6, Keppra 10.1. 

#Fever - Febrile in ED, also tachycardic unclear source. Highest 
suspicion for aspiration PNA. CXR at OSH without obvious focal 
consolidation. No meningeal signs on exam. S/p cefepime in ED. 
Given suspicion for aspiration and hypoxemia, treated with IV 
unasyn for aspiration pneumonitis. He was switched to augmentin 
at time of discharge to complete 7 day course of abx to end on

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

You were admitted with seizures.  We gave you your seizure 
medicines and you did not have any further seizures.  Your 
platelets are low, which is not new, but they did drop quite a 
bit while you've been here in the hospital. These stabilized 
prior to you going home. Your bilirubin blood level, which is 
related to your liver, increased during admission this peaked 
and went down prior to your discharge. Both of these are from 
your alcohol use. 

It is important that you take your medication as prescribed and 
that you follow up with your  Neurologist to help adjust your 
medications so you have better 
seizure control. In order to help with taking your medications, 
we have set up ___ to help you manage your medical conditions 
and help you take your medications 

Your medications regimen is as follows:
Keppra 1500mg (2 pills of 750mg each) twice per day
Vimpat 200mg (1 pill of 200mg) twice per day

We also prescribed you some vitamins to help with your 
nutrition. 

We also strongly recommend that you go to outpatient alcohol 
rehab. We are worried that you may pass away if you continue to 
drink.

Brief Hospital Course:
ICU COURSE ___ - ___
Mr. ___ is a ___ ___ speaking man originally right 
handed (lost his right hand at ___ in an accident) with PMHx 
significant for HTN, HLD, and a prior stroke with resulting left 
sided weakness who was found down on the morning of ___ by his 
family.  NCHCT revealed an IPH in the right thalamus extending 
down into the midbrain with intra-ventricular extension, as well 
as a small amount of L convexity blood. His exam is significant 
for left face, arm and leg weakness and numbness along with 
severe dysarthria. His mental status is poor with waxing and 
waning alertness. Initially, He was at very high risk for 
hydrocephalus and required close monitoring in the ICU. Serial 
NCHCTs were stable however, and the most likely etiology for his 
poor mental status was ultimately felt to be due to poor sleep 
and medication (Seroquel overnight ___.
The Most likely etiology of his bleed is HTN, based on location. 
Most likely etiology for his SAH is trauma, again, based on 
location.

NEURO: R thalamic IPH extending into midbrain w IVE

___ 12:00PM URINE RBC-<1 WBC-2 Bacteri-NONE Yeast-NONE 
Epi-___ year old man with epilepsy (likely primary generalized 
epilepsy) who was in his usual state of health until he came 
home at 18:30 and was altered and with evidence of facial/head 
trauma. While in the ___, he developed RUE and RLE 
weakness and was found to have a small cortical and subcortical 
left parietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage. He was electively 
intubated for transfer to ___. Admitted to neuro ICU where he 
was extubated the next day. Transferred to ___. 

Etiology of his hemorrhage was unknown. Vascular malformation 
remained high on the differential given young age and location 
of bleed. CTA showed no evidence of vascular malformation, and 
conventional angiogram was performed, which was also normal. 
Less likely hypertensive given location, less likely amyloid 
given age. Hemorrhagic metastasis remains possible, though we 
have no evidence of malignancy. 
MRI was attempted multiple times, including with anxiolysis, but 
Mr. ___ was not able to tolerate it due to claustrophobia. 
We will therefore obtain interval imaging with outpatient open 
MRI. 

Course complicated by hypertension, initially requiring 
nicardipine gtt to maintain SBP<150 in the setting of acute 
hemorrhage, subsequently stabilized on lisinopril and labetalol. 
At the time of discharge, we are continuing to cross-titrate 
lisinopril and labetalol. 
Course also complicated by urinary retention. Per patient 
preference we have been performing intermittent straight 
catheterization rather than foley placement. 
Additionally, he has current EtOH abuse, and has been monitored 
on CIWA. No signs of withdrawal during this admission. 
=================================
[ ] wean labetalol to off if tolerated. If hypertensive without 
beta-blockade, would consider once, or twice- daily medication 
such as Metoprolol XL or carvedilol for ease of medication 
regimen. 
[ ] consider starting medication to treat presumed BPH given 
persistent urinary retention. 
[ ] Two month interval MRI to be performed approx. ___. 
[ ] Monitor CIWA q8h for at least approx. ___ days. 
[ ] PCP consider starting statin no earlier than ___. 
[ ] PCP consider referring to therapist/psychiatrist for EtOH 
abuse

Dear Mr. ___,
You were hospitalized due to symptoms of right-sided weakness 
resulting from an ACUTE HEMORRHAGIC STROKE, a condition where a 
blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain is 
blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your body that 
controls and directs all the other parts of your body, so damage 
to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply can result 
in a variety of symptoms.
Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:
High blood pressure

We are changing your medications, please take your medications 
as prescribed.

Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.

If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:
- Sudden partial or complete loss of vision
- Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth
- Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you
- Sudden weakness of one side of the body
- Sudden drooping of one side of the face
- Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body

Sincerely,
Your ___ Neurology Team

Brief Hospital Course:
___ ___ with HTN and s/p resection of benign mass 
(uncertain what) on L side of head ___ years ago who presents with 
IPH following a fall and aspiration pneumonia, now on comfort 
measures only.

#Intraparenchymal hemorrhage.  Patient ___ transferred to 
___ from ___ for neurosurgical evaluation. The 
neurosurgical team evaluated the patient and her imaging and 
determined that she was not a surgical candidate. the patient's 
neurological exam was poor, so the family made the decision to 
make her DNR/DNI and CMO and terminally extubated her on ___. 
After she was extubated her neurological exam initially 
improved. She was able to respond to her name, move her R arm 
and leg, and follow commands. At that point the family decided 
to lift the CMO order and the patient was transferred to a 
general medicine team. Neurology was consulted.  Given the large 
size and severity of the intraparenchymal hemorrhage, her 
significant cerebral edema (with anticipated development of 
worsening edema), and poor neurologic exam the patient was 
ultimately transitioned to comfort measures only.  

#) Aspiration-type PNA.  The patient was having trouble 
protecting her airway following the intraparenchymal hemorrhage. 
A chest x-ray obtained on ___ showed a patchy area of 
opacification in the L lung base concerning for aspiration 
pneumonia. She was made NPO to prevent further aspiration and 
was treated empirically with vanc/cefepime. When the patient was 
made comfort measures only, the antibiotics were stopped.

#) GI bleed.  There was a concern for GI bleed because EMS 
reported seeing coffee ground emesis when they arrived to the 
site where she had fallen. Her initial Hgb was 13.2 at ___. 
___, and upon arrival to the ___ ED (___) it had dropped 
to 11.2. A repeat Hgb on ___ was 10.9. She had no further 
emesis or melena while at ___. No further workup was performed 
as she was made comfort measures only. 

#) E. coli UTI.  A urine culture from ___ came back positive 
for >100,000 organisms/mL of E.Coli. She was treated with 
cefepime initially, but antibiotics were stopped when she was 
made comfort measures only.
  
#) GPC bacteremia.  The patient grew MRSA in ___ blood culture 
bottles from the same set from ___. She was 
initially treated with IV vancomycin, but the antibiotics were 
stopped when she was made comfort measures only.   

#) NSTEMI. The patient had initial Trop-T of 0.14 and a second 
Trop-T of 0.18, but there were no EKG changes consistent with 
ACS. It is likely that the troponin leak was due to demand 
ischemia in the setting of a significant Hgb drop and the stress 
of the IPH. 

Transitional Issues:
- The patient is being sent to ___. ___ for comfort care so 
that she may be closer to her family
- Code: Comfort Measures Only
- No health care proxy documentation obtained; none available in 
PCP's office or prior ___ records. Daughter ___ 
(___) is next of kin.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,

___ were admitted to the hospital for an intraparenchymal 
hemorrhage. While here, neurosurgery decided that surgery would 
not be helpful or change your prognosis. Initially ___ were made 
comfort measures only, and ___ were extubated. ___ did better 
than expected and your neurological exam improved so ___ 
remained DNR/DNI, but the decision to make ___ comfort measures 
only was reversed. ___ were then transferred to a general 
medicine team. Neurology was consulted and offered aggressive 
treatment; however, they informed ___ that the aggressive 
treatment was unlikely to change the poor prognosis. Ultimately 
your family decided to put ___ back on comfort measures only. 

___ were transferred from ___ to ___ to have comfort 
measures care closer to home.

Thank ___ for choosing ___ for your healthcare. It was a 
pleasure taking care of ___.

Sincerely,

IMAGES/STUDIES
==============
___ Hip plain film
FINDINGS: There is an acute subcapital fracture of the left 
proximal femur. No additional fracture is seen. There is no 
diastases of the pubic symphysis or the sacroiliac joints. Mild 
degenerative changes are seen at the bilateral hip joints. 
Suture material is seen within the pelvis. There is moderate 
colonic fecal loading. Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted. 
IMPRESSION: Acute left subcapital femoral fracture. 

___ L femur plain film
FINDINGS: No acute fracture is seen at the distal left femur. 
Mild degenerative changes are present at the left knee, most 
severe at the medial compartment. Vascular calcifications are 
noted. There is no knee joint effusion. IMPRESSION: No fracture 
or dislocation seen at the distal left femur. 

___ CXR
FINDINGS: AP portable supine view of the chest. Left chest wall 
Port-A-Cath is noted with catheter tip in the region of the SVC. 
Cardiomegaly is again noted. There has been no significant 
change from prior exam. Lungs remain hyperinflated with hilar 
congestion and scattered bilateral predominately reticulonodular 
opacities. Findings remain concerning for pulmonary edema though 
superimposed atypical infection is difficult to exclude. Tiny 
effusions likely present. No pneumothorax. Bony structures 
remain grossly intact. IMPRESSION: As above. 

___ MRI Brain
FINDINGS: Multiple sequences are limited by motion artifact. 
There is a hemorrhagic lesion in the right postcentral gyrus 
with low signal throughout gradient echo images. Evaluation of 
signal characteristics on precontrast T1 weighted and T2 
weighted images is limited by motion artifact, but only minimal, 
if any, T1 hyperintensity seen. The postcontrast axial T1 
weighted spin echo images are distorted by motion artifact at 
the level of late lesion. The lesion demonstrates hyperintensity 
on the postcontrast MP RAGE images, suggesting contrast 
enhancement. It measures 1.4 x 1.2 x 0.9 cm on the postcontrast 
MP RAGE images, 900:91 and 9:175. There is associated vasogenic 
edema extending from the subcortical white matter to the atrium 
of the right lateral ventricle. There is mild sulcal effacement, 
but no effacement of the right lateral ventricle, and no shift 
of midline structures. Gradient echo images demonstrate no 
evidence of blood products elsewhere in the brain parenchyma. 
Motion limited postcontrast MP RAGE and T1 weighted images 
demonstrate no additional enhancing lesions. T2 weighted and 
FLAIR images demonstrate extensive T2 hyperintensity in the 
periventricular and deep white matter of the cerebral 
hemispheres, as well as scattered T2 hyperintense subcortical 
white matter lesions, which are nonspecific but likely sequela 
of chronic small vessel ischemic disease in this age group. 
There is diffuse T2 hyperintensity within the pons without mass 
effect, which may also be secondary to chronic small vessel 
ischemic disease. Postcontrast MP RAGE images suggest a 
developmental venous anomaly involving the left pons and 
midbrain, with possible associated faint flow voids on T2 
weighted images ; this is not seen on the motion degraded 
postcontrast T1 weighted spin echo images. There is no acute 
diffusion abnormality. Ventricles and sulci are normal in size 
for age. Cerebellar tonsils are normally positioned. Major 
arterial flow voids appear grossly preserved. Major dural venous 
sinuses appear patent on postcontrast MP RAGE images. There is 
mild mucosal thickening in the ethmoid air cells. IMPRESSION: 1. 
Significantly motion-limited exam. 2. The hemorrhagic lesion in 
the right postcentral gyrus appears to demonstrate contrast 
enhancement, suggesting a metastasis. While there is associated 
vasogenic edema, there is no mass effect on the right lateral 
ventricle and no shift of midline structures. 3. No evidence for 
additional hemorrhagic lesions. No additional enhancing mass 
lesions are detected on significantly motion-limited evaluation. 
4. Probable developmental venous anomaly involving the left pons 
and midbrain. RECOMMENDATION(S): Follow up MRI with and without 
contrast is recommended when blood products resolve. 

___ CT Pelvis MTS
FINDINGS: There is a mildly impacted (roughly 4 mm) subcapital 
left femoral neck fracture with trace valgus angulation. There 
is no definite underlying lesion. There is no other fracture or 
dislocation. Well-circumscribed 3 mm sclerotic lesion in the 
right iliac bone is unchanged and likely represents a bone 
island (02:14). No suspicious focal lytic or sclerotic bony 
lesion. There is trace bilateral hip joint degenerative 
spurring. Mild degenerative changes of the pubic symphysis. 
Bilateral SI joints are preserved. Mild degenerative changes of 
the imaged lower lumbar spine. Limited evaluation of bilateral 
knees is grossly unremarkable. Limited evaluation of the 
intrapelvic/abdominal structures is notable for large volume 
ascites. Foley catheter is seen within the bladder with diffuse 
wall thickening. Postsurgical changes from a low anterior 
resection. Additional small bowel anastomosis seen in the right 
lower quadrant. No definite enlarged lymph nodes are identified. 
There is diffuse superficial soft tissue edema. Prominent 
scattered vascular calcifications are noted. IMPRESSION: 1. 
Mildly impacted subcapital left femoral neck fracture with trace 
valgus angulation. No definite underlying bone lesion. If there 
is continued concern, MRI can be performed. 2. No other fracture 
or dislocation. 3. Large volume ascites and diffuse anasarca. 4. 
Diffuse bladder wall thickening around a Foley catheter. 
Correlate with urinalysis as this may represent cystitis. 

___ EEG
IMPRESSION: This was an abnormal continuous ICU EEG monitoring 
study due to the slow and disorganized background throughout, 
indicating a widespread encephalopathy. Medications, metabolic 
disturbances, and infection are among the most common causes. 
Nevertheless, no clear focal abnormalities were evident, 
although encephalopathies may obscure focal findings. Especially 
early in the recording, there were frequent generalized sharp 
waves, but they abated during the course of the recording. They 
did not include spike or sharp and slow wave complexes or any 
repetitive discharges. There were no electrographic seizures 

___ TTE
Conclusions The left atrium and right atrium are normal in 
cavity size. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color 
Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. There 
is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal 
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>65%). 
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular 
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size 
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are 
moderately thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient 
consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally 
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is moderate 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a very small 
circumferential pericardial effusion without echocardiographic 
signs of tamponade. IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy with preserved regional and global biventricular 
systolic function. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. Minimal aortic valve stenosis. Increased PCWP. 

___ ___
FINDINGS: Study is moderately degraded by motion. Additionally, 
beam hardening artifact limits evaluation of brainstem and 
inferior posterior fossa. Within these confines: There is no 
evidence of large territorial infarct. Again seen is a 
hyperdense lesion measuring 1.1 cm in the right post central 
gyrus, with associated vasogenic edema. This appears stable 
compared to recent prior exams. There is no new mass effect. No 
other foci of hemorrhage or edema are noted. The ventricles and 
sulci are normal in size and configuration. There are 
periventricular follow-up pontine and subcortical lucencies, 
which may represent small vessel ischemic changes, are again 
noted. There is no evidence of fracture. IMPRESSION: 1. Study is 
moderately degraded by motion. 2. Stable right post central 
gyrus hemorrhagic lesion with surrounding vasogenic edema. 
Please note underlying mass is not excluded on the basis of this 
examination. Recommend follow-up imaging to resolution. 3. No 
new foci of hemorrhage or edema. RECOMMENDATION(S): Stable right 
post central gyrus hemorrhagic lesion with surrounding vasogenic 
edema. Please note underlying mass is not excluded on the basis 
of this examination. Recommend follow-up imaging to resolution 

___ KUB
FINDINGS: There is marked gaseous distention of the stomach.  A 
biliary metallic stent is identified with resulting pneumobilia 
in the left lobe of the liver.  The small large bowel appears 
unremarkable.  Air-fluid levels are identified in presumably the 
stomach.  Orthopedic hardware is identified in the left femur. 
IMPRESSION: Gaseous distention of the stomach. 

___ Chest xray
FINDINGS: Compared to ___, there is mild improvement of 
the nodular component of pre-existing bilateral parenchymal 
opacities. Heart size is mildly enlarged. Mediastinal silhouette 
is within normal limits. Left pectoral Port-A-Cath terminates in 
the upper to mid SVC. There is persistent small pleural effusion 
on the right. IMPRESSION: Mild improvement of the pulmonary 
edema compared to ___. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year-old woman with small cell lung cancer on chemotherapy, 
diastolic CHF, and COPD (2L O2 at home with BiPAP at night) who 
was transferred from ___ for a right parietal 
hemorrhagic mass lesion suspicious for metastasis and left 
femoral neck fracture. Initially admitted to the trauma ICU with 
neurosurgery and trauma surgery managing, however her initial 
workup did not reveal any emergent surgical issues; her status 
progressed to a toxic metabolic encephalopathy picture with 
hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, for which she was 
transferred to the MICU and then to the medical floor.

# Small cell lung cancer with right parietal hemorrhagic mass: 
Patient has history of small cell lung cancer currently 
receiving chemotherapy with topotecan. Mass lesion concerning 
for metastatic lesion on MRI brain. Neuro-oncology consulted and 
Keppra was administered for seizure prophylaxis. Radiation 
Oncology was also consulted and felt that if her condition 
stabilizes, she could be suitable for whole brain radiation 
therapy. Goals of care discussion was held and determined that 
the patient still wished to pursue treatment despite a poor 
prognosis. Prior to discharge, her outpatient oncologist, Dr. 
___, was contacted and a plan was made to likely resume 
chemotherapy ___ weeks post-discharge. Given her clinical 
improvement, she was again seen by Radiation/Oncology who again 
recommended whole brain radiation. The patient's preference was 
to return to a facility closer to home, therefore Rad/Onc 
treatment will be arranged following discharge. Apart from the 
altered mental status described earlier, she was not noted to 
have any focal neurologic deficits during admission. 

# Left femoral neck fracture: Secondary to mechanical fall with 
evidence on CT pelvis. Orthopedics consulted and underwent ORIF 
on ___. Anticoagulation held given hemorrhagic brain mass 
per NeuroOncology but was placed on ___ for mechanical DVT 
prophylaxis. On the floor, she was seen and treated by Physical 
Therapy who recommended further rehabilitation following 
discharge. Wound care per Orthopedics and was weight bearing as 
tolerated by discharge.

# Toxic Metabolic Encephalopathy: Patient reportedly AOx3 at 
baseline, became acutely altered on the afternoon of ___ in 
the setting of receiving 8 mg IV morphine for pain, which 
subsequently exacerbated hypercarbia as below. A repeat head CT 
did not show any change from prior. Her mental status gradually 
improved with treatment of her respiratory issues, as described 
below. She was kept on an EEG for >24 hours with findings 
consistent with TME and without evidence of seizures. Continued 
on Keppra 500mg BID for seizure prophylaxis.

# Mixed hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure: Patient has 
a history of COPD (on 2L O2 at home with BiPAP at night) and 
became hypercarbic in the setting of receiving morphine for 
pain. She also has a history of diastolic CHF with evidence 
volume overload on CXR and exam. Bilateral pulmonary opacities 
on CXR with mild leukocytosis also concerning for possible 
superimposed pneumonia. Patient treated for CAP with 
levofloxacin. Received steroids for COPD exacerbation and 
standing nebulizers with improvement in respiratory status and 
overall mental status. Patient frequently refused nighttime 
BiPAP and but was able to tolerate it briefly with gradual 
improvement labs and clinical status. Noticed to frequently 
desaturate while off BiPAP. Narcotics were limited only for 
breakthrough pain and maximized on non-opiates for pain control. 


# Acute on Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure: No prior ECHO in OMR 
but per TTE on ___ she has mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy with preserved regional and global biventricular 
systolic function, moderate pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension, minimal aortic valve stenosis and increased PCWP. 
BNP 7579 on ___. Home furosemide was held during admission but 
was intermittently diuresed gently in MICU and then restarted on 
___. Aspirin was held in setting of ICH. Metoprolol was held 
when titrating blood pressure control but was also restarted on 
___ in the setting of atrial tachycardia.

# Hypertension: Patient persistently hypertensive on arrival 
Nicardipine gtt was used to keep SBP <160. Drip was weaned and 
she was transitioned to oral agents including home 
spironolactone and HCTZ and increased dose of lisinopril from 10 
to 40mg.

# Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: history 
of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with prior episode at OSH 
prior to transfer. Home metoprolol held on admission given need 
for tight blood pressure control. On the night of ___, she 
had an episode of asymptomatic atrial fibrillation with rates to 
150s. She was given IV metoprolol and then IV diltiazem with 
resolution of her rates to ___ and a return to NSR. The need for 
anticoagulation was deferred given acute onset and 
contraindication from recent ICH.

# Constipation: during the patient's floor course, she was noted 
have significant constipation likely secondary to opiate use. 
KUB showed gaseous distention without evidence of obstruction. 
Aggressive bowel regimen ordered and patient defecated on 
___ with relief of symptoms.

# Anemia: macrocytic with hemoglobin 9.0 on admission with 
gradual trend downward with phlebotomy and s/p orthopedic 
surgery. Likely secondary to active malignancy with no signs of 
active bleeding on exam. Received 1U pRBCs on ___ with 
appropriate response. Monitored daily CBC and uptrending on 
discharge. 

Chronic Issues:
# Coronary artery disease: Held aspirin and continued statin. 
# Gastroesophageal reflux disease: home omeprazole held on 
admission and given IV pantoprazole while in ICU. Transitioned 
to oral and will resume home dose on discharge. 
# Depression: Held home citalopram initially in ICU, restarted 
at dose listed in PCP note from ___ (20mg)

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ y/o M s/p fall and helmeted crash from scooter 
with + head ___ and brief LOC, + ETOH. He was brought to the 
ED via ambulance where a head CT showed an intraparenchymal 
hemorrhage within the left frontal lobe measuring up to 7.5 mm 
without mass effect or surrounding edema. The patient was noted 
to have a left forehead laceration and sutures were placed. The 
patient was admitted to the Acute Care Surgery service for 
further medical care. 

On HD1, the patient was evaluated by Neurosurgery for the L IPH 
and he was started on Keppra 500mg BID x 7 days. The patient had 
a CT c-spine which was negative for acute fracture or 
subluxation.  On Tertiary exam, the patient reported left knee 
pain with motion, blurred vision in his left eye, and cervical 
spinal tenderness. The patient was placed in a hard collar and 
an MRI c-spine was ordered which showed no evidence of spinal 
cord injury or significant vertebral canal narrowing. The 
patient's hard collar was later removed and a soft collar was 
ordered for comfort. Left knee x-ray was negative for fracture. 

The patient was alert and oriented throughout hospitalization; 
pain was managed with oral acetaminophen, oxycodone and 
hydromorphone IV for breakthrough pain. The patient remained 
stable from a cardiovascular and pulmonary standpoint; vital 
signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary toilet, early 
ambulation and incentive spirometry were encouraged throughout 
hospitalization. Diet was advanced to a Regular diet, which was 
well tolerated. Patient's intake and output were closely 
monitored.  The patient's fever curves were closely watched for 
signs of infection, of which there were none. The patient's 
blood counts were closely watched for signs of bleeding, of 
which there were none.  On HD2, the patient was started on 
subcutaneous heparin and ___ dyne boots were used during this 
stay and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as 
possible.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
and hemodynamically stable. The patient worked with Occupational 
and Physical Therapy and he was cleared to be discharged home 
with outpatient Physical Therapy.    The patient was tolerating 
a diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was 
well controlled.  The patient received discharge teaching and 
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and 
agreement with the discharge plan.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the acute care service after he was 
struck by a motor vehicle.  He did not sustain any loss of 
consciousness.  Upon admission, he was made NPO, given 
intravenous fluids, and underwent imaging.  He was reported to 
have sustained a right hand, ankle, and a fibula fracture.  He 
also sustained facial abrasions and a small bleed in his head. 
On tertiary examination, he was reported to have a fracture of 
the right ___ metacarpal.  His vital signs were closely 
monitored during his hospitalization.

Because of his injuries, several services were consulted. The 
orthopedic service was consulted in regards to his right fibula 
fracture and right knee effusion.  As per their recommendation, 
a right knee immoblizer was applied and he progressed to weight 
bearing as tolerated. Cat scan of his head showed a small 
extra-axial left tentorial hemorrhage without focal neurologic 
deficits. His neurological status was monitored and no surgical 
intervention was indicated. On tertiary survey, the patient was 
found to have a right fifth metarcarpal fracture, and the hand 
service was consulted.  Closed reduction was attempted and a 
splint was applied. The patient removed the splint and a cast 
was applied.  Vascular assessment was performed and there was no 
vascular compromise reported. The patient was noted to have 
increased right eye swelling on HD #3 and the Opthamology 
service was consulted. The patient did not report any visual 
changes. On examination, he was reported to have a 
subconjunctival hemorrhage with mucoid discharge.  The patient 
was placed on erythromycin eye oinment and bacitracin ointment 
to his right brow abrasions.  

During his hospitalization, his vital and neurological signs 
have been stable. He has been encouraged to use the incentive 
spirometer.  He has been tolerating a regular diet.  His 
electrolytes have been closely monitored and borderline levels 
repleted.   

The patient was evaluated by physical therapy and 
recommendations made for discharge to an extended care facility 
where he will have the opportunity to regain his strength and 
return to his baseline activity level.  Follow-up appoinments 
have been scheduled with Orthopedics, Opthamology, Acute care 
service and the hand service.

white matter demonstrated on T2 and FLAIR sequences, are 
nonspecific and may reflect changes due to small vessel disease. 
 There is a sequela of chronic ischemic hemorrhagic event in the 
left basal ganglia. 
4.  Prominent bilateral extra-axial spaces may represent chronic 
subdural/hygromas 

-CT ___ ___:

significantly increased in size compared to ___, 
indicating 
interim development of subdural hygromas superimposed upon prior 
small chronic 
subdural hematomas.  New associated frontal and parietal sulcal

air.  Partially visualized pubic bone fractures are better 
evaluated on the torso CT dated ___. 
The enteric tube tip is seen projecting over the left upper 
quadrant and 
appears somewhat high placed, with the tip pointing cranially, 
however is 
likely within the stomach in this patient with known eventration 
of the left hand diaphragm with a high placed stomach.

3. Bibasilar opacities, right more than left, may represent 
infection or aspiration, less likely atelectasis, similar to 
___ but worse than on ___. 
4. Left diaphragmatic hernia is similar to ___

-PORTABLE ABDOMEN Study Date of ___:  Nonspecific bowel 
gas pattern without obstruction, unchanged from ___. 

-KNEE (AP, LAT & OBLIQUE) RIGHT Study Date of ___: 
IMPRESSION:    
No previous images.  The bony structures at the knee joint and 
joint spaces are essentially within normal limits.  There may be 
a small joint effusion. Several small opacifications projected 
over the midportion of the knee joint on the frontal view could 
well represent free joint bodies.  Adjacent to the upper portion 
of the lateral condyle is a curvilinear opacification that most 
likely represents sequela of a previous avulsion injury.  If 
there are specific acute symptoms referable to this area, the 
possibility of an acute avulsion could be considered. 
Several old healed fibular fractures are seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is an ___ ___ speaking w/PMHx of 
early-dementia presenting on ___ after ___ found to have b/l 
subdural hematomas, multiple pelvic fx, who was transferred to 
medicine with fevers and altered mental status and was found to 
have pneumonia and a UTI. He completed an 8 day course of 
vanc/cefepime for HCAP and complicated UTI. His course was 
complicated by prolonged hypoactive delirium. He has been slow 
to respond and although he has shown improvement in level of 
alertness and speech, he remains altered, AAOx0-1, and less 
interactive and oriented than his baseline. Seen by Ortho, who 
determined no surgical intervention was for his pelvic fracture. 
Intermittent tachycardia and tachypnea (without hypoxia), most 
likely secondary to pain and agitation, lower extremity venous 
Doppler ultarsound and CTA neg for DVT/PE. Increased 
LDH/GGT/AlkP most likely ___ brief cholecystatic biliary 
picture, imaging showing some mild GB sludge. 

# Sepsis: on ___ patient triggered on ACS service for fever 
to 103. Met all 4 SIRS criteria. Possible sources included 
urinary given culture significant for  E. coli with resistance 
to Bactrim vs HCAP/aspiration given lower lobe consolidation CXR 
findings vs RUQ pathology given elevated bilirubin. He was 
started on broad-spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin and zosyn 
for x8 day course due to c/f HCAP along with standing IV Tylenol 
to help alleviate fever. A RUQ U/S revealed gallbladder sludge 
without evidence of liver pathology or inflammation/infection. 
His LFTs were trended and his bilirubin returned to normal. His 
WBC trended down to normal. During treatment, patient's 
platelets trended up and given concern for Zosyn side-effect, he 
was transitioned to cefepime. He completed a full x8 day course 
of antibiotics and remained afebrile. Thrombocytosis is 
resolving at time of discharge (672 on discharge, ~1000 at 
peak).

# Elevated alk phos: patient was noted to have elevated alk phos 
(peak at 250) in the setting of normal transaminases and no 
abdominal pain. GGT was found to be elevated, suggesting hepatic 
origin of alk phos. RUQ U/S revealed gallbladder sludge in the 
setting of prolonged poor oral intake. Given no hepatic findings 
on RUQ U/S, thought gallbladder sludge most likely etiology of 
elevation. His alk phos was trended and downtrended to 195 on 
___. He had no abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting for the 
duration of his hospital course, and was able to tolerate his 
diet.  

# Elevated LDH: Broad differential for elevated LDH in this 
patient including neurologic ___ cerebral hemorrhage vs 
gastrointestinal including pancreatitis vs bowel obstruction vs 
hepatitis vs hematologic  vs resorption of pelvic hematoma vs 
ineffective erythropoiesis vs PE vs trauma. Hemolysis labs were 
sent which showed high haptoglobin, high ferritin, low iron c/w 
mixed iron deficiency/inflammation picture. Reticulocyte count 
was normal. His LDH was monitored closely and stably downtrended 
to 250 on day of discharge. 

# Thrombocytosis: Platelets normal on admission and were noted 
to be significantly increasing, nearly 1000k at peak. Most 
likely reactive in setting of infection vs trauma vs 
medication-induced vs anemia. Review was notable for increase 
correlating with initiation of antibiotics and Zosyn known to 
induce thrombocytosis so this was changed to cefepime. His 
platelets were trended and downtrended over the rest of his 
admission.

# Tachycardia: toward end of treatment with antibiotics, patient 
was noted to be persistently in 100s. Possible etiologies 
include pain vs dehydration vs PE/DVT given trauma and not 
receiving anticoagulation. Lower extremity venous Doppler 
ultrasound and CT angiogram of the chest were negative for 
DVT/PE. He received IVF boluses and his pain was controlled with 
Tylenol/tramadol PRN.  

# Abdominal distension: On day of transfer to medical service, 
abdominal exam was significant for mild-moderate distension. Per 
nursing, patient having small daily bowel movements. A KUB was 
notable for colonic distension on CXR c/f ileus vs obstruction. 
Review of medication record revealed minimal narcotic 
administration. His tube feeds were held and KUBs were trended, 
revealing resolution of his distension. He was evaluated by 
speech and swallow who felt patient was safe for thickened 
liquids. Given concern for hypersensitivity to narcotics, his 
pain was treated with Tylenol and tramadol PRN. He tolerated po 
feeding well with no recurrence in distension. 
 
# Altered mental status: per son, pt is normally AAOx3 and 
independent at baseline. On transfer. On ACS was evaluated by 
Neurology and monitored on EEG; initially showed short runs of 
epileptiform activity, not meeting criteria for seizure, but on 
continued monitoring EEG continued to improve and was able to be 
discontinued. Given no concrete seizure activity, no 
anti-epileptic medications were started. During stay, mental 
status continued to improve until patient became extremely 
delirious in the setting of sepsis. He was monitored closely on 
delirium precautions and had clearing of his mental status as 
his infection improved. Patient was started on Seroquel 12.5mg 
qhs and increased bowel regimen and became increasingly lucid 
(improved level of alertness, participating in exam and 
interview, although still below baseline level of cognition and 
orientation), was AAox1 at time of DC.

# Intracranial hemorrhage: on presentation, patient was noted to 
have bilateral subacute subdural hemorrhages. He had no focal 
neurologic signs; however he was noted to be AAOx0-1 for much of 
his hospitalization while his baseline is AAOx3. He was 
evaluated by Neurosurgery who felt no surgical interventions 
were needed. He was monitored with repeat CT ___ studies which 
showed stabilization of hemorrhages. Neurosurgery will follow 
the patient as an outpatient, and recommended a repeat CT ___ 
in x8 weeks at time of follow-up. Appt has been scheduled. 

# Pelvic fracture: on admission, patient was noted to have left 
LC1 pelvic fracture, right mild SI joint widening and superior 
pubic ramus fracture. Ortho was consulted. Given that the 
patient was neurovascularly intact on exam, it was felt that 
surgical intervention could be deferred pending improvement in 
overall health. Following treatment of sepsis and moderate 
improvement in mental status, patient began working with 
Physical Therapy to determine extent of right-sided 
weight-bearing status and need for further orthopedic 
intervention. Repeat imaging had shown possible worsening of the 
fracture, ortho determined no surgical intervention was still 
necessary. Pt was found to have Rt knee pain as well; X-rays 
were done and Ortho determined this to be nonspecific 
contraction and avulsion fracture of lateral femoral condyle, 
reviewed imaging, determined also to not require surgical 
intervention.

**TRANSITIONAL ISSUES***
-Pt will follow up with Neurosurgery with Dr. ___ in 8 weeks 
with repeat ___ for f/u on intracranial hem
-Pt will f/u with Dr. ___ in Orthopedics in 2 weeks for 
f/u of his fractures
- Given patient's underlying dementia and advanced age, and the 
severe injury he sustained with hospital course complicated by 
sepsis, he has had severe hypoactive delirium and has been slow 
to respond. See mental status noted above. It is unclear at this 
time where his peak mental status baseline will be, but he will 
have a prolonged recovery. 
-Pt's home Mirtazipine and Risperdone was DC'd in the hospital,

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to ___ after you were hit by a car. You were 
found to have bleeding in and around your brain. Fortunately, on 
a repeat CT scan image of the ___, the bleeding did not worsen 
over time, and so you did not require surgery for your brain 
bleeding.  You also developed pneumonia and a UTI while in the 
hospital that were treated with antibiotics and your infection 
appeared to have cleared as you were no longer having fevers or 
other symptoms of infection. Our orthopedic surgeons evaluated 
your multiple pelvic fractures and knee pain, and determined 
that you would not need surgery but would improve with physical 
therapy. We started you on a new medication at night called 
Seroquel, to help improve your mental status and help you have a 
normal sleep cycle, and it appears to have helped over the first 
several days. 

It was a pleasure taking care of you!

We hope you get better and stronger in Rehab!

___!

 - MS: Awake, very pleasant & warm, interactive and engaging.
Knows her name but is not oriented to year, month, day, or place
without my prompting. Able to identify that I am a doctor and
then to sort out that she is in a hospital, though she does not
know which. Knows the days of the week forwards but not in

cut, but does attend more briskly to visual stimulus in the 
right
field. Difficult to parse out field cut from neglect given her
ability to participate. Tracks with apparently full EOM and no
apparent nystagmus. Face symmetric to touch. Slight left NLFF at
rest but activates well. Audition equal, palate rises

IMAGING
========
NCHCT (___):
1. Large right parietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with 
intraventricular 
extension into the right greater than left occipital horns and 
the local mass effect with surrounding edema.  No prior exam 
available on PACS to compare progression. 
2. Probable sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease, 
difficult to fully evaluate without priors. 
3. Global extensive cortical volume loss.

NCHCT (___):
1. Right parietal intraparenchymal hematoma is slightly larger 
compared to 1 day ago, with grossly stable uppercase mass-effect 
and edema. 
2. Interval redistribution of intraventricular hemorrhage 
3. No definite new hemorrhage identified.  

NCHCT (___): No significant change since the previous CT 
when accounting for differences in 
slice selection.  The hematoma as well as intraventricular blood 
and 
ventricular size appears stable. 

R HIP (UNILAT 2 VIEW) W/PELVIS (1 VIEW) (___): No fracture. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is an ___ with a past medical history of atrial 
fibrillation on apixaban and dementia (unclear which type) who 
presented ___ after being found down at home; NCHCT revealed a 
right parietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with intraventricular 
extension. She was admitted to the neurologic ICU for close 
monitoring given the size of the bleed and the intraventricular 
extension.

While in the ICU, she remained clinically stable. Due to SBPs 
being elevated to the 170s at presentation, she was placed on 
nicardipine gtt with a goal of SBP < 140. This was discontinued 
on hospital day #2 (___) after BP normalized. Serial NCHCTs 
initially showed a mild increase in the size of the bleed and 
then normalized. Pt was transferred to the floor on hospital day 
#2 and BP parameters were widened to a goal SBP < 160. She was 
maintained on metoprolol and amlodipine. 

Her bleed was felt to be likely due to her use of 
anticoagulation combined with underlying cerebral amyloid 
angiopathy (relate to her underlying dementia). At the same 
time, she had atrial fibrillation, which puts her at higher risk 
of stroke. Her CHADS-VASc score is 5 (hypertension, diabetes, 
age >___, female), which puts her risk for ischemic stroke due to 
afib at 12.5%. Her HASBLED score, on the other hand, is 3(HTN, 
elderly, drug therapy) or 4 (if one includes her current IPH) if 
she were to be continued on apixaban, which puts her at high 
risk of bleeding (4.9-19.6% risk of bleeding within the next 
year on a novel anticoagulant). 

At the time of discharge, the decision was made to discontinue 
anti-coagulation indefinitely given pt's risk of having a 
devastating second bleed. MRI was not done as it was felt this 
would not alter management.

Otherwise, pt was found to have a UTI at presentation which was 
treated with a course of ceftriaxone. Urine cultures grew 
<100,000 ORGANISMS/ML of coagulase negative staphylococcus, 
which was likely skin contaminant. Given her elevated WBC count 
(although pt on prednisone), she will continue on macrobid for 
full 7 days of treatment. 

Pt was started on her home medications apart from apixaban on 
hospital day #2. Physical and occupational therapy and speech 
and swallow therapy worked with her during her hospitalization 
and recommended rehab. 

Of note, she was complaining of hip/back pain with negative hip 
XR; pain resolved so no spinal imaging obtained.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,  
 
You were hospitalized due to symptoms of inability to get 
started after a fall resulting from an ACUTE INTRAPARENCHYMAL 
HEMORRHAGE, a condition where a blood vessel providing oxygen 
and nutrients to the brain has bled. The brain is the part of 
your body that controls and directs all the other parts of your 
body, so damage to the brain can result in a variety of 
symptoms.  
 
Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:  
- atrial fibrillation
 
We are changing your medications as follows:  
- stop apixaban 
 
Please take your other medications as prescribed.  
 
Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician.  

 
If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
- sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
- sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
- sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
- sudden weakness of one side of the body  
- sudden drooping of one side of the face  
- sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is an ___ yo F admitted to the Emergency department 
in acute distress after being struck by a motor vehicle. She was 
intubated for increased confusion and deteriorating mental 
status. She sustained multiple injuries as described below. She 
was admitted to the intensive care unit.

CT head showed small bifrontal SDH and small R IPH. Neurosurgery 
recommended 7 days keppra and repeat head CT stable. Hourly 
neurochecks remained intact.

Patient sustained bilateral orbital roof fractures(R>L) 
associated with concern for R retrobulbar hematoma, s/p lateral 
canthotomy and superior and inferior cantholysis. Opthalmology 
was consulted. No further intervention done. Patient will need 
outpatient 

Orthopedic surgery evaluated her left lateral compression type 1 
unstable pelvic fracture with anterior to posterior completion 
fracture of the right sacral ala and right proximal tibia 
comminuted fracture. There were both repaired in the OR on 
___. Please see operative report for details. 

Plastic surgery evaluated the facial fractures and recommended 
non-operative management at this time. 

A foley catheter was placed for bladder wall injury seen on 
cystogram for 2 weeks total. After removal, patient voided 
without difficulty. Urine culture positive for e.coli but 
patient asymptomatic and therefor antibiotic treatment was not 
indicated. 

Remainder of hospital course summarized below:

Neuro: The patient was appropriately sedated while intubated. 
After extubation, patient confused, agitated. Multiple 
antipsycotics including Haldol and Seroquel were attempted. 
Geriatric medicine was consulted and patient was put on a 
regimen with clonidine and Remeron with good effect. Mental 
status greatly improved, alert, calm, pleasant and interactive 
but still some confusion worse at night. While in the ICU hourly 
neuro checks were stable. Once on floor, she continued to be 
stable for a neurologic perspective. Completed 7 days keppra for 
seizure prophylaxis. 
CV: Blood pressure were closely monitored with arterial line. 
Initially required blood pressure support with vasopressors as 
needed. She had an episode of rapid afib and given amioderone 
with chemical conversion. No episodes of afib after and 
amioderone was not continued. Metoprolol started for rate 
control and goal blood pressure <140. 
Pulmonary: The patient was initially intubated on sedation. On 
___ she was extubated, initially required BiPap and then high 
flow nasal canula. Oxygen was gradually weaned to room air. 
Chest xrays were routinely monitored and showed pulmonary edema. 
She was diuresed with Lasix and her oxygen requirements 
decreased. No evidence of pneumonia.  
GI/GU/FEN: On ___ she failed speech and swallow evaluation and 
therefor a nasogastric feeding tube was placed and tube feed 
titrated to goal without issues. Once mental status improved, 
speech and swallow re-consulted and patient cleared for modified 
consistency diet. Calories were monitored and PO intake 
adequate; nasogastric tube removed. Foley catheter removed 14 
days post placement for bladder injury; no issues voiding. 
Levothyroxine started in ICU and discontinued once clinical 
status improved. TSH .02, free T4 4.7. Patient's intake and 
output were closely monitored.
ID: The patient's fever curves were closely watched for signs of 
infection, of which there were none.
HEME: The patient's blood counts were closely watched for signs 
of bleeding, her hematocrit initially tended down but then 
stabilized. She received 2 units of PRBCs in the emergency 
department
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin starting 
on ___ with clearance from neurosurgery and ophthalmology. ___ 
dyne boots were used during this stay and was encouraged to get 
up and ambulate as early as possible. Physical therapy and 
occupational therapy were consulted and recommended discharge to 
rehab. 

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
and hemodynamically stable.  The patient was tolerating a diet, 
ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  The patient received discharge teaching and 
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and 
agreement with the discharge plan.

IMAGING:  
 CXR ___:  
 Small left pleural or extrapleural hematoma is responsible for 
greater density left hemi thorax, associated with angulated 
fractures lateral aspects of left middle ribs. No pneumothorax 
or pulmonary contusion. Normal cardiomediastinal silhouette.  

CXR ___:  
 Uniform opacification of the left hemithorax likely reflects a 
layering pleural effusion. Multiple left-sided ribs are 
fractured in at least 2 places each. Lateral fractures of the 
fifth, sixth, and seventh ribs are moderately displaced. Low 
lung volumes cause bronchovascular crowding. Allowing for 
technique, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is likely normal. 
There is mild cardiomegaly.  
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Multiple left-sided ribs are fractured laterally and 
posteriorly.  
 2. Uniformly increased density over the left lung suggests 
layering pleural effusion.  
 3. Low lung volumes.

Discharge Diagnosis:
List of Injuries: 
L rib fx ___ post, ___  
 L clavicle frx  
 SAH  
 R gluteal hematoma  
 Nondisplaced left occipital skull frx  

 
Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital after your crash for your 
subarachnoid hemorrhage, rib fractures, pneumothorax, gluteal 
hematoma, and left clavicular fracture. You are now well enough 
to be discharged home. 

* Your injury caused multiple rib fractures which can cause 
severe pain and subsequently cause you to take shallow breaths 
because of the pain.
 
* You should take your pain medication as directed to stay ahead 
of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep breaths. If 
the pain medication is too sedating take half the dose and 
notify your physician.
 
* Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures.  In order to 
decrease your risk you must use your incentive spirometer 4 
times every hour while awake.  This will help expand the small 
airways in your lungs and assist in coughing up secretions that 
pool in the lungs.
 
* You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to hold 
against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing and 
deep breathing.
 
* Symptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short 
periods may ease the pain.
 
* Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you 
should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid 
and fiber intake if possible.
 
* Do NOT smoke
 
* If your doctor allows, non-steroidal ___ drugs 
are very effective in controlling pain ( ie, Ibuprofen, Motrin, 
Advil, Aleve, Naprosyn) but they have their own set of side 
effects so make sure your doctor approves.
 
* Return to the Emergency Room right away for any acute 
shortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation 
around your ribs (crepitus).

History of Present Illness:
___ woman with a past medical history of hypertension 
and
breast cancer treated ___ years ago with lumpectomy radiation 
and
tamoxifen presented to ___ after becoming acutely
confused. A baseline the patient is completely independent able
to drive, pay bills, and ambulate. The patient lives alone in a
ground floor apartment but speaks with her daughter at least
every other day if not daily as well as with her sister daily.
She was completely normal around ___ and new years.
Approximately, two weeks ago her daughter noticed that she was a
little bit less energetic than normal that she was talking less
on the phone and seemed fatigued. The patient began to complain
of headaches approximately five days ago. She did not qualify 
the
headache to her daughter but she did not take any medications
other than her daily aspirin to treat pain. Yesterday, the
patient spoke with her daughter and was excited about watching
the championship football game. Although she seemed a little 
less
talkative than normal and she complained of her headache she was
otherwise at baseline. When the patient's daughter called her
this evening, it quickly became obvious that there was something
wrong. The patient kept asking her daughter over and over again
what she planned to do today despite it being 730 at night. The
patient was unable to describe the football game and had many
other inappropriate phrases and responses to her daughters
questions (although she was able to form the words properly). 
Her
daughter became concerned and asked the patient's son to go by
the house to check. When he arrived, he had to climb in through
the back window and found her sitting on the couch snoozing. She
was confused and did many inappropriate things like try to talk
into the remote control as if it was phone. She also had a very
unsteady gait which is new for her. There was no evidence of 
fall
or any kind of trauma.  Although the patient has a history of 
two
falls, they are in the distant past and associated with either
getting her shoe caught or slipping on a wet floor. She has had
no illnesses or traumas recently. The patient's son took her to
___ where she was found to have an intraparenchymal
hemorrhage with intraventricular extension on non-con CT of the
head. She was transferred to ___ for acute management.

IMAGING:

--CT Head w/ and w/o contrast, ___:
1. Proximal hemorrhage involving the right basal ganglia and 
surrounding white matter, stable compared to 7 hr earlier, with 
stable intraventricular extension. 
2. Decreased dilatation of the lateral and third ventricles 
compared to 7 hr earlier. 
3. No evidence for an arteriovenous abnormality in the area of 
the right 
parenchymal hemorrhage, which is most likely hypertensive. 
4. Small caliber of the vertebrobasilar system secondary to 
fetal-type right posterior cerebral artery and fetal left 
posterior cerebral artery. Mild narrowing of the distal basilar 
artery. 2 mm basilar tip aneurysm at the expected origin of the 
aplastic left P1 segment. This is highly unlikely to be related 
to the patient's right basal ganglia hemorrhage. 

--MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST, ___:
1. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage centered in the right basal 
ganglia with 
intraventricular extension, as seen on the prior exams. This is 
most likely due to a hypertensive hemorrhage. No enhancing 
lesions to suggest metastatic disease. 

--CHEST (PORTABLE AP), ___:
There is an asymmetric left lower lung opacity, which could be 
due to 
infection in the correct clinical setting. The right lung is 
clear. The 
cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal. No pneumothorax 
or large 
effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs ___ is a ___ yo woman with PMH significant for HTN and 
breast Ca who presented with lethargy and malaise for 1.5-2 
weeks, followed by 5 days of progressive headache leading up to 
confusion and inappropriate behavior on the day of admission. 
She was initially taken to ___ where she was found to have 
an IPH with intraventricular extension on CT Head. She was 
transferred to ___ for acute management. 

#Right Basal Ganglia (caudate) Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage: MRI 
head showed known IPH centered in right basal ganglia with 
intraventricular extension, most likely hypertensive in nature 
although her blood pressure has been well controlled while 
inpatient; there was no evidence of metastatic disease, vascular 
abnormality, or amyloid angiopathy on MRI or CTA. She will 
probably need repeat MRI imaging in 2 months to further assess 
for underlying lesion once the hematoma has cleared. On exam, 
she was inattentive with some left sided weakness in an upper 
motor pattern. The patient was initially admitted to the 
neuro-ICU but was quickly transferred to the floor service for 
further management. Blood pressure has been well controlled on 
home meds (amlodipine and atenolol). Aspirin and NSAIDS should 
be held for 2 weeks post-bleed. She was treated with tylenol and 
fioricet prn in the acute setting while NSAIDS are 
contraindicated. 

#Hyponatremia/SIADH: She developed hyponatremia secondary to 
intracranial hemorrhage. Urine/serum labs were consistent with 
SIADH. Her sodium continued to trend downward despite fluid 
restriction so she was started on salt tabs. She should continue 
to have her electrolytes monitored at rehab.

#Acute Kidney Injury: Creatinine increased from 0.9 to 1.2 in 
the setting of fluid restriction for SIADH. Her fluid 
restriction was liberalized to 2000mL from 1500mL.

#Urinary Tract Infection: Found to have a UTI, culture grew 
Klebsiella pneumoniae, treated with 3 day course (6 doses) of 
Bactrim DS 1g BID, completed ___.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- hold aspirin x 2 weeks
- consider repeat MRI in 2 months to look for underlying lesion
- please trend sodium daily until it normalizes. She has been 
hyponatremic (to 126/127) and on a fluid restriction while here 
and was started on salt tabs.

or cane).

 
Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were hospitalized due to symptoms of headache and confusion 
resulting from an ACUTE HEMORRHAGIC STROKE, a condition in which 
there is bleeding in the brain. Damage to the brain can result 
in a variety of symptoms.

Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having another 
brain bleed. In order to prevent future hemorrhagic strokes, we 
plan to modify those risk factors. Your risk factors are:
- high blood pressure
- history of cancer

Your MRI did not show any underlying brain mass. Your outpatient 
neurologist may decide to repeat this test in a few months. 

Your brain bleed has led to low sodium levels in the blood. 
Please continue to decrease that amount of liquid you drink per 
day to around 1.5 liters (about 6 cups a day). You should have 
your electrolytes checked at rehab and your fluid restriction 
can be adjusted once your sodium level improves. 

Please take your medications as prescribed.

Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician.

If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:
- sudden partial or complete loss of vision
- sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth
- sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you
- sudden weakness of one side of the body
- sudden drooping of one side of the face
- sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body
- sudden difficulty pronouncing words (slurring of speech)
- sudden blurring or doubling of vision
- sudden onset of vertigo (sensation of your environment 
spinning around you)
- sudden clumsiness of the arm and leg on one side or sudden 
tendency to fall to one side (left or right)
- sudden severe headache accompanied by the inability to stay 
awake

It was a pleasure providing you with care during this 
hospitalization.

Sincerely,
Your ___ Neurology Team

IMAGING:
========
NCHCT (___): small left temporal IPH. extensive white matter 
hypodensities. evidence of prior right basal ganglia injury. 

EEG (___) 
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal awake and sleep EEG, because of 
frequent bursts of generalized, frontally predominant delta 
slowing indicative of a deep subcortical midline dysfunction. 
There are no clear epileptiform discharges or electrographic 
seizures. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was admitted to the neurology stroke service for 
monitoring and further work up of her intraparenchymal 
hemorrhage. She was continued on her home antihypertensive 
medications without change in order to prevent further bleeding. 


She underwent a brain MRI which did not show evidence of an 
acute infarction with secondary hemorrhage and there were no 
masses seen; however, the study was severely limited due to lack 
of patient cooperation. She will have a follow-up scan as an 
outpatient in ___ weeks to assess for interval change and 
possible causes for her bleed. 

Her ability to name objects improved slightly during her 
hospital stay, but she continues to be disoriented to place and 
year (continues to answer that we are in ___ or on the ___ 
and that it is ___. Because the location of her bleed was not 
consistent with the degree of acute cognitive changes seen in 
Ms. ___, we were concerned about possible underlying dementia 
that would be expected with evolving cerebral amyloid 
angiopathy; however, her family notes that prior to this event, 
she was living independently and performing all ADLs without 
assistance, making this an abrupt/acute change. We obtained an 
EEG to rule out occult seizures. This showed generalized, 
frontally predominant delta slowing but no seizure or 
epileptiform activity.   

She was found to have a mild macrocytic anemia. B12 and folate 
levels were drawn, but are pending at the time of discharge. She 
was previously found to be B12 deficient. We started her 
empirically on cyanocobalamin supplementation.

Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.

 
Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,
  
You were hospitalized due to symptoms of difficulty speaking and 
thinking resulting from an ACUTE HEMORRHAGIC STROKE, a condition 
where a blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain 
breaks and leaks blood into the brain. The brain is the part of 
your body that controls and directs all the other parts of your 
body, so damage to the brain from being deprived of its blood 
supply can result in a variety of symptoms. 
 
Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. 

Your risk factors are:  
- High blood pressure
- Possible cerebral amyloid angiopathy
  
It is very important to keep your blood pressure well-controlled 
to help prevent future strokes. Please continue taking your 
blood pressure medicines (atenolol and amlodipine) as previously 
prescribed. 
  
Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below. You will also need to have a repeat MRI of your 
brain in ___ weeks to further assess the bleed. 

If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
- Sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
- Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
- Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
- Sudden weakness of one side of the body  
- Sudden drooping of one side of the face  
- Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body

IMPRESSION:
 
 
1. Stable hemorrhagic focus within the left occipital lobe, 
possibly
representing lobar hematoma.  Possibility of hemorrhagic 
neoplasm is not
excluded.
2. No evidence of vascular malformation or aneurysm.
3. Atherosclerotic disease at the right carotid bifurcation with 
less than 25%
right internal carotid artery stenosis by NASCET criteria.
 
RECOMMENDATION(S):  Correlation with MRI of the brain is 
recommended for
further characterization of a left occipital hemorrhagic focus.  
Additionally
long-term followup until complete resolution of the hematoma is 
recommended to
rule out underlying abnormalities in the region.

CT head
IMPRESSION:
 
 
1. Interval stability of left occipital intraparenchymal 
hemorrhage with
associated vasogenic edema.

MRI head
IMPRESSION:
 
 
1. Unchanged 18 x 14 mm left occipital intraparenchymal 
hemorrhage without
definite underlying lesion.  Continued surveillance imaging to 
resolution of
hemorrhage is recommended in order to exclude an underlying 
lesion which could
be obscured by hemorrhage.
2. No infarct, new hemorrhage, or enhancing mass.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ right handed woman with a pmhx of epilepsy on longstanding 
Dilantin and OSA who presents with clumsiness and bumping into 
things, found to have small left occipital IPH of unclear 
etiology. The CTA does not show any obvious vascular 
malformation. MRI with contrast Brain redemonstrates the left 
occipital hemorrhage with some peripheral enhancement with 
contrast but no intralesional enhancement to suggest a tumor. 
The plan is to repeat MRI in ~1 month to assess for underlying 
lesion. She will then follow up with neurology and neurosurgery 
for possible angiography. She as evaluated by ___ who recommended 
home with outpatient ___. She was advised against driving. She 
was advised to stop taking her home celecoxib for the time 
being. She was discharged in stable condition.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___ - 

You were admitted to ___ with symptoms of right sided visual 
loss which is due to an intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH) (bleed 
in your brain). You underwent CTA head which did not show any 
abnormal vessels. MRI brain redemonstrated the hemorrhage which 
is located in the back of the brain in a region called the 
occipital lobe.
We will repeat your MRI brain in ~4 weeks to get a better view 
once the blood is reabsorbed.

To schedule the MRI brain please call ___.

Please stop taking your home celecoxib for the time being. Use 
Tylenol as a pain reliever if needed. No other changes were made 
to your medications. 

Given your visual symptoms, you should not drive.

Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.

If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:
- Sudden partial or complete loss of vision
- Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth
- Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you
- Sudden weakness of one side of the body
- Sudden drooping of one side of the face
- Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body

History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is an ___ year old woman on ASA with a past medical 
history significant for dementia and HTN who was found down by 
her son this morning s/p fall of unclear etiology, thought to 
have had a mechanical fall in her basement, with large IPH on 
imaging as well as swollen left eye found to have orbital floor 
blow out fracture without signs of entrapment. 

Per her son, she lives alone and is unsteady on her feet with 
multiple recent falls. Per her daughter they had been 
considering assisted living options secondary to her 
deteriorating functional status. 

After being found down this morning, she was initially brought 
to an OSH ED where she had a c-spine CT as well as head CT 
showing the IPH and was then transferred to ___ ED. In the ED, 
she was oriented x1 which is reportedly worse than baseline 
where she is oriented to herself and family, however not to 
month/date. 

She was evaluated by plastic surgery who felt that her orbital 
floor fracture was non-operable. She was also noted to have a 
swollen right knee and x-rays were ordered. Her ED course was 
notable for a troponin elevation to 0.23 and cardiology was 
consulted, who reportedly felt that this was demand mediated 
only without STEMI/NSTEMI.  

She was keppra loaded for seizure prophylaxis and admitted to 
the TSICU. On the way to the TSICU, a repeat head CT was 
performed to evaluate for interval change/expansion of the IPH.

Imaging:
=======
 Portable Chest xray AP
IMPRESSION:    
Left base opacity which could be due to consolidation from 
infection or 
aspiration versus atelectasis.  Dedicated PA and lateral views 
would be 
helpful for further evaluation if/when patient able. 

___ Non-contrast Head CT:
IMPRESSION:   
1. Interval increase subarachnoid hemorrhage overlying right 
cerebellum. 
2. Stable inferior right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage. 
3. Prominence of the bilateral extra-axial spaces may partially 
represent 
chronic bilateral subdural hemorrhages versus involutional 
changes. 
4. Complete opacification of the left sphenoid sinus with 
central high density 
material may represent inspissated secretions or fungal 
colonization.  
Thickening of the walls of the sphenoid sinus suggests chronic 
sinusitis. 
5. Evolving right parietal scalp soft tissue swelling and 
hematoma. 

___ Chest Xray PA and Lat
IMPRESSION:    
Rapidly improving left lower lobe opacity favors atelectasis or 
aspiration over an infectious pneumonia. 

___ CTA Head
IMPRESSION:   
1. Study is limited due to poor bolus tracking.  Allowing for 
the limitations, intracranial arteries appear unremarkable. 
2. Right cerebellum subarachnoid hemorrhage, right frontal 
intraparenchymal hemorrhage, and prominent bifrontal subdural 
space are similar to 14 hr ago. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ male with AAA, hypertension, hypothyroidism with h/o 
multiple falls who presented s/p fall on ___ found to have small 
intracerebral hemorrhage and chronic subdural collections. 

# Falls complicated by cerebellar SAH, frontal IPH, and chronic 
SDH:  Pt presented s/p mechanical fall on ___.  Serial CT scans 
show small stable cerebellar SAH, frontal IPH, and chronic SDH 
that was non-operative per neurosurgery. He has had multiple 
falls with a significant one ___ resulting in residual 
dysarthria. He reports he falls at least once monthly (inside 
and outside), often when turning. Of note, he has been evaluated 
by neurology in the recent past and he is undergoing a workup 
for a possible neurodegenerative disorder as the etiology of his 
falls (provider documents in physical chart and faxed to 
neurology/concussion clinic).  He was evaluated by ___ and OT who 
recommended discharge home with ___. He was provided with a 
walker prior to discharge for improved gait stability and fall 
prevention. He will follow up with PCP, neurology/concussion 
clinic, and neurosurgery. He will have a repeat CT head ___. 

# Post-concussive syndrome: Mental status exam notable for 
diminished attention and recall. Also noted on OT assessment. ___ 
assessment notable for impaired visual function, balance and 
coordination likely due to central vestibular dysfunction given 
known location of injury.  As above, pt will have ___ at home 
with a new walker and will follow up with the 
___ clinic and neurosurgery as outpatient. 

# Possible aspiration:  CXR on admission with possible evidence 
of aspiration prompted a speech and swallow consult.  Bedside 
speech and swallow evaluation demonstrated ""soft signs of 
aspiration"" and a diet of regular solids and nectar thick 
liquids was recommended.  Of note, pt did not demonstrate any 
clinical evidence of pneumonia or aspiration pneumonitis during 
his hospital course.  

# Hypertension:  Continued home lisinopril and metoprolol.

# Hypothyroidism: Continued home Levothyroxine.

# Possible CAD:  Despite neurosurgery clearance for restarting 
aspirin, held home aspirin at discharge given prescribed for 
primary prevention.  Pt and family denies history of MI or PCI.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ man who presents the ED with
complaints of headache and foot pain.  Neurology is consulted 
due
to findings of a intraparenchymal hemorrhage.  History is
obtained primarily from his son ___.

He is otherwise been his usual state of health without any 
recent
illnesses.  On ___, he apparently fell at home.  He 
was
in bed when around 8 ___ he tried to get out of bed.  He states
that he was unable to tell where the edge of the bed was and he
fell out of bed, striking his head on the floor and also 
injuring
his toes.  There was no loss of consciousness.  He called out to
his wife, and with her assistance was able to get back into bed. 

He slept on and off throughout the night.  Over the next 2 days,
he spent most of his time on the couch watching TV, which is
typical for him.  He had a persistent headache.  He describes
this as a holocephalic pounding.  He also complained of some 
pain
in his feet.

His son also notes that occasionally he seemed more confused 
than
usual.  He would frequently repeat questions that had just been
asked.  He made some occasional paraphasic errors, but was able
to recognize that he use the wrong word.

Throughout this time, there is no weakness, sensory change,
repeat falls, vision changes, slurred speech or difficulty
speaking.

Due to the ongoing headache and foot pain, his family brought 
him
to the emergency department.  After receiving Tylenol and IV
fluids, his headache is better.  He denies any prior history of
neurologic event, including stroke, TIA.

His son reports that his father is generally able to function at
home independently.  He lives with his wife, and together they
manage most ADLs and IADLs.  It is not unusual for him to be
somewhat confused the about things like current events.  He does
not drive due to long-standing blindness.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ man with a history of CLL who 
presented to the ED after a fall 2 days prior, with complaints 
of headache. Neurology was consulted due to findings of an 
intraparenchymal hemorrhage. His initial exam was notable for 
some disorientation, inattention, and tangential speech. His 
head CT demonstrated a small, round hemorrhage in the left 
temporal lobe w/ no evidence of vascular malformation on CTA 
head/neck. MRI demonstrated stable left anterior temporal 
intraventricular choroid plexus acute hemorrhage w/ adjacent 
intraparenchymal edema BUT NO evidence of acute infarct. 
Etiology of this hemorrhage remains unclear at this point. It is 
not a typical location for hypertensive hemorrhage nor 
characteristic for amyloid angiopathy. Coagulopathy from his CLL 
may be contributing or could be traumatic after recent fall. His 
aspirin was held, and he was admitted to the stroke service on 
neurology stepdown unit for close monitoring (initial SBP goal 
<150). His headache improved, and ___ evaluation recommended 
rehab.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were hospitalized due to symptoms of headache resulting from 
an ACUTE HEMORRHAGIC STROKE, a condition where blood supply 
providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain is interrupted due 
to bleeding. The brain is the part of your body that controls 
and directs all the other parts of your body, so damage to the 
brain from being deprived of its blood supply can result in a 
variety of symptoms.

Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:
FALL RISK

We are changing your medications as follows:
HOLD aspirin until ___ (7 days after stroke)

Please take your other medications as prescribed.

Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.

If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:
- Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth
- Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you
- Sudden weakness of one side of the body
- Sudden drooping of one side of the face
- Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body

Sincerely,
Your ___ Neurology Team

In sinus with frequent PACs and asymptomatic throughout 
admission. Troponin plateaued at 0.02, CK-MB 2, no ischemic ECG 
changes. TSH 4.9. TTE ordered but not completed prior to 
discharge, plan for outpatient TTE. Continued home diltiazem 
extended release 300mg QD for rate control. CHADS2Vasc score of 
3, started apixaban 5mg BID this admission.

#Chest pain: Patient describes pressure over left chest that has 
been occurring intermittently over the past 2 weeks. Not 
exertional or positional. No known history of CAD, mild troponin 
elevation (plateaued at 0.02), no concerning ECG changes. Pt 
feels that the chest pain is different than his typical 
heartburn/esophageal reflux. Plan for outpatient follow up and

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,  

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___.  

WHY WAS I IN THE HOSPITAL?  
==========================  
- You were admitted because your heart was beating in an 
irregular rhythm called atrial fibrillation and you were having 
some chest pain over the past two weeks.

WHAT HAPPENED IN THE HOSPITAL?  
==============================  
- You were started on a medication called apixaban that reduces 
the risk of blood clots and stroke in patient with atrial 
fibrillation. Your previous home medication aspirin was 
discontinued because taking apixaban and aspirin together 
increases risk of bleeding.
- You were started on a nasal saline spray to help prevent 
nosebleeds, which can happen more often when you are taking 
apixaban.
- You did not have chest pain at the hospital. You should follow 
up with Dr. ___ in Cardiology clinic for further workup.
- Your heartburn medications were adjusted to see if it would 
help with the chest pain.
- You were noted to have white blood cells and red blood cells 
in your urine. There were no bacteria and no symptoms that 
suggest a urinary tract infection. You should see your 
outpatient PCP for further workup of the urine abnormalities.

WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I GO HOME?  
================================  
- It is very important to take your apixaban twice a day to 
prevent clots and stroke.
- Please take your medications as prescribed, note that there 
have been some changes during this hospital admission.
- Please attend follow up appointments with your PCP and 
cardiologist.

Thank you for allowing us to be involved in your care, we wish 
you all the best!

IMAGING
=======
- ___ CTA Head
1. Right thalamic low genius ___ hyperdense lesion with
surrounding edema. Though this may represent an evolving
hematoma, the possibility of an underlying neoplasm should be
considered.  MR imaging would be helpful. 
2. Unremarkable head CTA. 
3. Partial opacification of the right mastoid air cells. 

- ___ CT Head
1. There is hemorrhage within right thalamus, with surrounding
edema, stable since prior.  Low-attenuation component extends to
the third ventricle.  Differential considerations include
involving hematoma or partially hemorrhagic mass.  Consider MRI
brain with gadolinium in further evaluation.  Suggestion of 
trace
intraventricular hemorrhage. 
2. Small area of right centrum semiovale subacute to chronic
ischemia within the background of mild chronic small vessel
ischemic changes. 
3. Moderate opacification of right mastoid air cells. 

- ___ TTE
The left atrium is normal in size. No thrombus/mass is seen in
the body of the left atrium. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF=55%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. The diameters
of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. There is mild aortic
valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae. 
Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 

___ UE ultrasound
IMPRESSION:  
-Nonocclusive thrombus surrounding the right PICC extending from 
the right 
brachial to the right subclavian veins. 
-No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the left upper extremity 
veins. 
  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is an ___ yo man with a history of CAD, systolic 
HF, HTN, HLD, possible dementia, hx infarct, hx NSTEMI who was 
found down at home on ___ at the bottom of a staircase, duration 
of time down is unknown. Was found to have a right thalamic IPH, 
also ___ due to rhabdomyolysis, troponinemia, and pulmonary
congestion vs aspiration. Admitted to ICU for respiratory 
distress, resolved with supportive care and antibiotics for 
likely aspiration event.

Brief ICU Course: 
Presented to the ED on ___, evaluated by neurology service, 
admitted to the neuro ICU on ___ for respiratory difficulties 
requiring maximum O2 on face tent. CXR showed bilateral basilar 
opacities, consistent with aspiration. Started on levofloxacin 
for aspiration. ABG remained stable. PICC was placed at bedside 
due to difficulty obtaining PIV. He became more somnolent, 
dysarthric, and confused that evening so a repeat CT was done 
which was stable, but better showed surrounding edema - 
consistent with either older bleed vs possible malignant lesion. 
Continued on fluids for CK elevation, also albumin and Lasix to 
improve urine output; these were effective. On ___ restarted 
home aspirin (but not Plavix) due to history obtained from PCP 
of extensive LAD disease. Failed swallow evaluation, and 
received NGT following day. Kidney function continued to improve 
(Cr 2.2->1.5) with good UOP, CK continued to downtrend 
(~4000->1500), and respiratory status also improved, and he did 
not require supplemental O2 by evening of ___ when he was 
transferred to floor. His home metroprolol dose was also resumed 
(50mg BID). 

# ICH - R thalamic IPH: ___ CT showed stable bleed with possibly 
enhanced edema, c/f malignancy vs older bleed.  Etiology 
hypertensiion vs malignancy, though likely the former. Given 
recent bleed, held off MRI, will need to be ordered as 
outpatient basis. He was continued on home aspirin. Blood 
pressure maintained under 150s. 

# Dysphagia: Initially he had issues with dysphagia, video 
swallow revealed ability to tolerate pureed solids and nectar 
thick liquids with 1:1 supervision and chin tuck.

# NSTEMI with hx CAD: Likely secondary to demand ischemia. 
Troponin peaked ___. EKG NSR. EF=55%. Resumed home dose 
metoprolol 50mg BID.

# Respiratory insufficiency: Improved. Likely secondary to 
aspiration. Initially suspected pulmonary edema due to heart 
failure however TTE normal. He received empiric treatment for 
aspiration pneumonia with levofloxacin.
 
# ___: likely due to rhabdomyolysis: Initially volume depleted 
(found down for unknown duration). Cr peaked at 2.2, on 
discharge 1.0. Initial CK ~4000.

# Left humeral fracture: displaced fracture of the greater 
tubercle. Seen by orthopedics, recommended sling. Non-operative. 
Has orthopedic follow up on discharge.

# Upper extremity DVT: patient had persistent mild leukocytosis 
without fever. Doppler ultrasound of the extremities revealed 
DVT of the brachial, axillary, and subclavian veins of the right 
arm, where the PICC was placed. The PICC was removed. Held off 
anticoagulation given recent intraparenchymal hemorrhage.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the Acute Care Trauma Surgery Service on 
___ after a fall that occurred 5 days prior. You had a CT 
scan of your head and were found to have a small right 
intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Your neurological exam was closely 
monitored and remained stable. You had a repeat CT scan of your 
head that showed your bleed was stable. The neurosurgery team 
was consulted and recommend that you take Keppra to prevent 
seizures for a total of 7 days. You can resume taking your 
aspirin on ___. Please follow up in the ___ clinic 
at your scheduled appointment listed below.

You were also found to have rib fractures. These will heal over 
time. 

You were seen by the occupational therapy team for a cognitive 
evaluation because you have a bleed in your head. You can follow 
up in the cognitive neurology/ concussion clinic as needed.  

Please note the following discharge instructions:
* Your injury caused rib fractures which can cause severe pain 
and subsequently cause you to take shallow breaths because of 
the pain.
 
* You should take your pain medication as directed to stay ahead 
of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep breaths. If 
the pain medication is too sedating take half the dose and 
notify your physician.
 
* Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures.  In order to 
decrease your risk you must use your incentive spirometer 4 
times every hour while awake.  This will help expand the small 
airways in your lungs and assist in coughing up secretions that 
pool in the lungs.
 
* You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to hold 
against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing and 
deep breathing.
 
* Symptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short 
periods may ease the pain.
 
* Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you 
should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid 
and fiber intake if possible.
 
* Do NOT smoke
 
* If your doctor allows, non-steroidal ___ drugs 
are very effective in controlling pain ( ie, Ibuprofen, Motrin, 
Advil, Aleve, Naprosyn) but they have their own set of side 
effects so make sure your doctor approves.
 
* Return to the Emergency Room right away for any acute 
shortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation 
around your ribs (crepitus).

___ where head CT showed intracranial hemorrhage vs. 
calcification, CXR and pelvic X-ray
wnl. Patient developed significant hypertension while at ___, repeat head CT showed no changes. He was evaluated by 
physical therapy at ___ who recommended ___ rehab. 
He was transferred to ___ for further evaluation of ICH. Here, 
his CXR was negative, CT C spine showed no acute fracture and 
likely degenerative
changes at C3-C4. Patient was evaluated by neurosurgery who 
noted
patient was A&Ox1 and able to follow commands, they recommended
ED obs and ___ evaluation. Overnight he became agitated and
complained of worsening headache. Repeat head CT this morning
showed stable small 3.5-mm R intraparenchymal hemorrhage. 
Patient was evaluated by ACS who found patient had negative 
tertiary survey and no evidence of acute trauma. Given lack of 
infectious cause, unchanged head CT, and concern that patient's 
mental status was not at baseline, decision was made to admit 
patient for workup of delirium as he was deemed to be unsafe to 
send home.  Of note, patient was thought to be at baseline 
mental status AOx1-2 with no new confusion or change from 
baseline on initial presentation at ___. 

Reportedly had insurance issues so patient had not seen PCP in 
several months and had also stopped home medications over the 
last month. These medications had been restarted over the last 
week. Family is considering nursing home placement in the future 
but not at this time.

Further collateral was obtained from his son. Some days, patient 
talks very little but other days it is possible to have a 
conversation with him. If he feels he is being pressured in 
anyway, he will stay quiet and will not participate in 
conversation. Patient will fall every few months. He will 
frequently refuse to his cane. His personality has become very 
resistant to cooperate with anyone, worsened with ___ Body 
dementia. Patient will typically know what season it is but may 
not know details of year/month. Son does note that over the last 
___ months, patient has been spending more time in bed - he may 
be in bed until ___ some days and return to sleep again at 
9pm.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old male presenting to ___ as bicycl___ struck by car. 
 Patient amnesic to the events. Head CT revealed 2 isolated foci 
of parenchymal hemorrhage in the left high frontal lobe, for 
which Neurosurgery was consulted. They recommended starting 
Keppra x7days and hourly neuro exams. Imaging also revealed 
displaced and angulated midshaft radial and ulnar fractures, 
right medial tibial plateau fracture, and right medial femoral 
condylar fracture. There was also a question of a left 6th rib 
fracture. Orthopedics was consulted, who reduced and splinted 
left forearm in ED. The patient was hemodynamically stable but 
noted to be confused and disoriented. He was admitted to the 
Trauma / ACS service in the TICU for q1h neuro exams and close 
monitoring. Due to worsening mental status, a repeat head CT was 
obtained on HD2 which showed a new hyperdensity in the left 
temporal lobe, suggestive of a new focus 
of cortical hemorrhage versus hemorrhagic conversion of a 
contusion.

The patient was taken to the operating room with the Orthopedic 
team on HD3 and underwent open reduction and internal fixation 
of proximal shaft radius and ulna fractures of the left upper 
extremity which went well without complication (reader referred 
to the Operative Note for details). For the right lower 
extremity tibia plateau fracture, Ortho recommended nonoperative 
management with ___ brace and partial weight bearing as 
tolerated. 

The patient was transferred to the floor in hemodynamically 
stable condition. He was alert and oriented to person and place 
but not of date. On HD5 the patient was complaining of new 
double vision. A repeat head CT scan was stable. The double 
vision improved. The patient worked with Physical Therapy and 
Occupational Therapy, who recommended rehab once medically 
cleared. 

Pain was well controlled. Patient tolerated a regular diet with 
good tolerability. The patient voided without problem. During 
this hospitalization, the patient ambulated with brace and 
plateau walker, was adherent with respiratory toilet and 
incentive spirometry, and actively participated in the plan of 
care. The patient received subcutaneous heparin and venodyne 
boots were used during this stay.

On HD7, Hand Surgery was consulted for inability to extend left 
___ and ___ MCPs, likely due to partial EDC tendon injury. Hand 
recommended  Volar resting splint intrinsic plus, and outpatient 
follow-up in the Hand clinic.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, mental 
status was improving, afebrile with stable vital signs. The 
patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating with 
assistance, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  The patient was discharged to rehab. The patient 
received discharge teaching and follow-up instructions with 
understanding verbalized and agreement with the discharge plan.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the orthopedic surgery service and 
was taken to the operating room for above described procedure. 
Please see separately dictated operative report for details. The 
surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the 
procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.

Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:

Patient's pain was controlled under consultation by the APS 
service 

Otherwise, pain was initially controlled by the acute pain 
service followed by a transition to oral pain medications on 
POD#1.  The patient received Lovenox for DVT prophylaxis 
starting on the morning of POD#1.  The foley was removed on POD 
*** and the patient was voiding independently thereafter. The 
surgical dressing was changed on POD#2 and the surgical incision 
was found to be clean and intact without erythema or abnormal 
drainage. The patient was seen daily by physical therapy. Labs 
were checked throughout the hospital course and repleted 
accordingly. At the time of discharge the patient was tolerating 
a regular diet and feeling well.  The patient was afebrile with 
stable vital signs.  The patient's hematocrit was acceptable and 
pain was adequately controlled on an oral regimen. The operative 
extremity was neurovascularly intact and the wound was benign.
The patient's weight-bearing status is weight bearing as 
tolerated on the operative extremity.

Mr. ___ is discharged to home with service in stable 
condition.

4. You have been given medications for pain control. Please do 
not drive, operate heavy machinery, or drink alcohol while 
taking these medications. As your pain decreases, take fewer 
tablets and increase the time between doses. This medication can 
cause constipation, so you should drink plenty of water daily 
and take a stool softener (such as Colace) as needed to prevent 
this side effect.  Call your surgeons office 3 days before you 
are out of medication so that it can be refilled.  These 
medications cannot be called into your pharmacy and must be 
picked up in the clinic or mailed to your house.  Please allow 
an extra 2 days if you would like your medication mailed to your 
home.

5. You may not drive a car until cleared to do so by your 
surgeon.

6. Please call your surgeon's office to schedule or confirm your 
follow-up appointment.

7. SWELLING: Ice the operative joint 20 minutes at a time, 
especially after activity or physical therapy. Do not place ice 
directly on the skin. You may wrap the knee with an ace bandage 
for added compression. Please DO NOT take any non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs such as Celebrex, 
ibuprofen, Advil, Aleve, Motrin, naproxen etc).

8. ANTICOAGULATION: Please continue your Lovenox for four (4) 
weeks to help prevent deep vein thrombosis (blood clots).  If 
you were taking aspirin prior to your surgery, it is OK to 
continue at your previous dose while taking this medication.

contusion, pneumonia or aspiration in the appropriate clinical 
setting. 
2. Endotracheal tube in appropriate position. 

Head CT ___
1. Status post evacuation of large right sided epidural hematoma 
with expected postsurgical changes including pneumocephalus. 
2. Persistent mixed density right parietotemporal subdural 
collection 
measuring 1.3 cm in maximal width.  No definite epidural

3. Decreased leftward shift of midline structures, uncal 
herniation, and 
transtentorial herniation. 
4. New hypodensities within the right parieto-occipital lobe are 
worrisome for right PCA infarct. 
5. New small subdural hematoma along falx with unchanged 0.8 and 
0.6 cm right anterior temporal lobe intraparenchymal 
hemorrhages.  . 

Head CT ___
1. Continued evolution of postoperative changes related to right 
parietal 
temporal craniotomy. 
2. Right convexity subdural hematoma and slight leftward midline 
shift are 
similar to 1 day ago.

CXR ___
In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and 
support 
devices are unchanged.  There is some increase in the asymmetric 
opacification at the left base, though no silhouetting of the 
heart border or hemidiaphragm. Although this could merely 
represent atelectatic change, in the appropriate clinical 
setting superimposed aspiration or even infectious pneumonia 
could be considered. 

Head CT ___
1. Unchanged sequelae of evolving right PCA territory infarct.

Comparison to ___.  The monitoring and support 
devices are in 
stable position.  The pre-existing retrocardiac opacity has 
substantially 
increased in extent and severity and is likely reflecting 
pneumonia.  New 
similar opacities visualized at the right lung basis and could 
represent a 
second infectious focus or an area of aspiration.  No pleural 
effusions.  No pulmonary edema.  Normal size of the heart. 

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of ___ 5:01 AM 
IMPRESSION:  
Compared to chest radiographs ___ through ___ ET 
tube ends at the thoracic inlet and should not be withdrawn 
further.  Right subclavian line ends close to the superior 
cavoatrial junction.  Feeding tube ends in the upper stomach.  
12:31. 
  
Compared to ___ mediastinal and pulmonary vessels are 
more engorged indicating a definite component of volume overload 
or cardiac decompensation.  
Bibasilar consolidation preceded the relative cardiac 
decompensation and has subsequently improved.  I can't 
distinguish between concurrent bibasilar 
pneumonia and dependent atelectasis and edema.  No pneumothorax. 

  
Pleural effusion is presumed but not substantial.  No 
pneumothorax.  Heart 
size is normal, but increased since ___. 

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of ___ 12:19 ___

changed 
compared to the prior study.  No evidence of hemorrhagic 
transformation or new infarction. 
2. Residual right subdural hemorrhage and minimal hyperdensity 
along the falx

4. Bifrontal pneumocephalus has decreased compared to the prior 
study. 
5. Fluid collection the right posterior cervical region is 
likely 
postsurgical, decreased in size compared to prior study. 

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of ___ 5:29 AM 
IMPRESSION:   
Comparison to ___.  The patient has been extubated. 
 The 
nasogastric tube and the right venous access line persists.  
Increase in 
extent of the pre-existing bilateral parenchymal opacities, with 
a 
distribution suggestive of aspiration.  Multifocal pneumonia 
would be another the differential diagnostic consideration.  No 
pleural effusions.  Borderline size of the heart.  No 
pneumothorax. 

___ CXR
Continued worsening of the bilateral predominately airspace 
opacities.  
Appearances suggest pulmonary edema but infection or hemorrhage 
could have a similar appearance.

___ CXR
Since the prior study the patient has been intubated, an 
endotracheal tube 
terminates 4.5 cm above the level carina.  A nasogastric tube 
terminates in the stomach.  Lung volumes are within normal 
limits.  No pneumothorax seen.  Predominate perihilar airspace 
opacities are consistent with pulmonary edema, asymmetric with 
increased opacity seen in the left lung. Infection or hemorrhage 
cannot be excluded.  Left lower lobe atelectasis.  There is a 
small left pleural effusion. 
 
___
Compared to chest radiographs ___ through ___ 
at 12:04. 
  
Widespread pulmonary opacification with basal predominance is 
probably 
combination of widespread pneumonia and pulmonary edema.  There 
was some 
improvement between ___ and ___, subsequently 
stable.  
Pleural effusion is likely, but not substantial.  Heart size 
normal.  No 
pneumothorax. 
  
ET tube in standard placement.  Transesophageal feeding tube 
ends in the upper stomach. 

___ CXR
Bilateral multifocal opacities with increasing opacities in the 
left lung 
base, small left pleural effusion, and left retrocardiac 
consolidation. 
Evolution of pulmonary findings with distention of the azygos 
vein raises the possibility of volume overload superimposed on 
known infection. 

___ BUE LENIs
No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the left upper extremity. 


___ CT Head without Contrast:
1. Evolving right PCA territory infarction stable when compared 
to prior 
study.  No new evidence hemorrhage or acute large territory 
infarction. 
2. Stable bifrontal subdural hygromas and posterior subdural 
hemorrhage with dural thickening. 
3. Mildly improved sulcal effacement and midline shift. 
4. Stable of fluid collection the right posterior cervical 
region likely 
representing postsurgical changes. 

___ Upper Extremity Ultrasound Study: 
1. No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the left upper 
extremity. 
2. There is a superficial thrombus noted in the distal cephalic 
vein.

 

___ CXR:
Comparison to ___.  Lung volumes have decreased.  
Increasing bilateral parenchymal opacities, notably on the 
right.  The findings are highly suggestive of pneumonia.  No 
pleural effusions.  Stable appearance of the cardiac silhouette. 


___ CT ABD:
1. Findings suggestive of lower lung infection.  Small left and 
trace right pleural effusions.  Given the bilaterally, 
aspiration is a consideration. 
2. A loop of redundant sigmoid colon has a somewhat abnormal, 
narrowed course, though there is no associated wall thickening 
or obstruction.  This may be related to peristalsis and a loop 
of redundant sigmoid colon, however, depending on clinical 
symptoms, consider intermittent volvulus.  No small bowel 
dilatation to suggest internal hernia. 
3. Trace perihepatic and small volume pelvic ascites. 
4. Healing right L3 and L4 transverse process fractures and 
lateral right ninth and tenth rib fractures. 

___ TTE:
Poor image quality (limited study due to patient discomfort). 
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses 
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to 
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality 
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic 
function is probably mildly depressed (LVEF= 50 %). There is no 
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and 
free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the 
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. No 
masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. The mitral 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No clear masses or 
vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully 
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. Mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery 
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal study to fully exclude endocarditis. If 
indicated, a TEE may better assess for valve vegetations.  

___ CT Chest:
Findings most likely represent diffuse/multifocal 
bronchipneumonia. 
Third-spacing of fluid as evidenced by pleural effusions, trace 
pericardial effusion, ascites and subcutaneous edema. Relative 
hypodensity of the blood pool suggests anemia. 

___ CT Head:
1. Evolving right PCA territory infarction stable when compared 
to prior study.  No new evidence hemorrhage or acute large 
territory infarction. 
2. Stable bifrontal subdural hygromas and posterior subdural 
hemorrhage with dural thickening. 
3. Mildly improved sulcal effacement and midline shift. 
4. Stable of fluid collection the right posterior cervical 
region likely representing postsurgical changes.

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a ___ male with past medical history
significant for traumatic right epidural hematoma while
intoxicated, status post right craniotomy for evacuation 
___,
complicated by herniation and right PCA infarct with prolonged
hospitalization, residual left-sided weakness and cognitive
symptoms, who presents with episodes concerning for seizures.

The patient was seen in consultation by Dr. ___
___ for new episodes witnessed by staff members of his
nursing facility yesterday.  Please see her note for details. 
Briefly, he had 3 episodes of whole body tremors, eyes rolling
back for 20 seconds, with return to consciousness.  This was
followed by a generalized event in which she had shaking of both
arms and legs.  It is not clear whether she remained awake or 
was
unconscious through this.  He presented to the ED, and after
evaluation was started on Keppra 750 mg twice daily, with
arrangements for outpatient EEG and first-time seizure clinic
follow-up.  Of note, he has had seizures in the setting of
alcohol and benzo withdrawal in the past, and has a history of
drug-seeking behavior.

He was given first dose of Keppra in the ED and discharged back
to his nursing facility.  Today, however, he reportedly had 2
more spells.  His description of the events today is 
inconsistent
with yesterday's report; he reports that he had an aura of
confusion, followed by a ""blackout of my vision"" for 20 minutes. 

He states he did not lose consciousness during that time, but
cannot specify whether he had involuntary movements or
incontinence or other behaviors during it.  Then his vision
returned, however for the next ___ minutes he remained confused
and disoriented.  Afterwards, he returned back to his baseline. 
Initially he told the ED he had 2 episodes, however he tells me
that he only had one.

ROS is essentially unchanged since yesterday.  He does report
depressed mood.  He is unable to state what medications he 
takes.
He reports that he was recently admitted to the nursing facility
from home a few weeks ago, and the plan is to return home after
his therapy is finished.  This was not corroborated by facility
staff.

while intoxicated, for which he underwent right craniotomy that 
was complicated by herniation and right posterior cerebral 
artery infarct ___ and residual left-sided weakness and 
cognitive deficits, who presented from his skilled nursing 
facility with multiple episodes of reported seizure-like 
activity. Of note, he was seen in the ___ Emergency Department 
just one day prior to admission for similar episodes. A 
non-contrast head CT did not reveal any evidence of acute 
intracranial process, and he was discharged on Keppra 750mg 
twice daily with scheduled outpatient EEG monitoring. However, 
the following day, he had two more episodes of spells of unclear 
semiology and was brought in to the hospital a second time. 
Examination on admission was notable for mild cognitive deficits 
and left-sided weakness. However, it was unclear how much of his 
hemiparesis was residual versus new. Continuous EEG monitoring 
revealed no evidence of seizures. During his admission he had an 
episode of right hand tremor and ""head rush"" which had no 
electrographic correlate. Of note, he has a right hand tremor at 
baseline.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital after having multiple episodes 
of reported seizures at your nursing facility. You were first 
seen in the Emergency Department on ___ for presumed 
seizures, then discharged back to your facility on a seizure 
medication called Keppra with outpatient follow-up. However, the 
following day, you reportedly had two more episodes of 
seizure-like activity and were brought into the hospital a 
second time. In order to monitor for any ongoing or new seizure 
activity, we connected you to a continuous EEG, a test that 
records your brain waves. The EEG did not show any seizures 
while you were here. Even though we did not see any seizures 
while you were here, we still think that the events you had 
before coming to the hospital were probably seizures. For that 
reason we want you to remain on levetiracetam (Keppra).

Otherwise, we do not need to make any changes to your 
medications.

nodules, mediastinal lymphadenopathy and a large R pleural 
effusion (former findings reported to be chronic per outpt 
oncologist). He required increasing oxygen requirements and due 
to acute hypoxia when lying flat on ___ was intubated. 
Thoracentesis was performed on ___ for R pleural effusion with 
studies suggestive of exudate per Light's Criteria. Pleurex 
catheter drained 2.2L of fluid and was removed on ___. Of note, 
pt's pilot balloon was cut on ___ with resulting cuff leak and 
requiring repair. On ___ pt was extubated and due to sudden 
hypoxia in the evening was reintubated.

STUDIES
==============
___
ANKLE XRAY
  
Distal fibular regularity concerning for fracture, although a 
diffuse 
osteopenia limits evaluation.  This is of unclear chronicity. 
.
.
CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST
1.  No evidence of acute injury within the chest. 
2.  1.1 cm spiculated nodule in the right upper lobe with 
background severe 
emphysema, concerning for neoplasm.  A PET-CT is recommended for 
further 
evaluation.  In addition, prior studies, if available, would be 
helpful for 
comparison. 
3.  Mild mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  Prominent right hilar 
soft tissue. 
4.  Mucous plugging in small airways in the right lower lobe and 
the lingula 
with nodular opacities which could reflect chronic 
inflammation/aspiration. 
  
RECOMMENDATION(S):  PET-CT is recommended for for evaluation of 
the 1.1 cm 
lung nodule. 
.
.
CTA HEAD AND NECK
  
1. Punctate hyperdensity in the right frontal lobe in keeping 
with an 
intraparenchymal hemorrhage.  There is no evidence of arterial 
phase contrast 
enhancement.  However, underlying intracranial metastasis or 
other is not 
completely excluded.  Further evaluation with MRI with without 
contrast is 
recommended. 
2. 5 mm inferiorly directed aneurysm at the right MCA 
bifurcation. 
3. Atherosclerosis involving bilateral carotid bifurcations 
without any 
stenosis by NASCET criteria. 
4. Otherwise unremarkable CTA of head and neck, allowing for 
common anatomic 
variations. 
5. Please refer to separate dictation of CT chest for chest 
findings, 
especially the partially visualized spiculated right upper lobe 
lung nodule. 
.
.
L AP AND LATERAL XRAY OF TIB/FIB
A distal left fibular fracture is better evaluated on dedicated 
ankle 
radiographs on the same day.  No other fracture or dislocation 
identified. 
.
.
___
MRI BRAIN
  
1. 1 cm focus of gradient echo susceptibility in the right 
frontal lobe 
corresponding to the hyperdensity seen on recent prior head CT.  
The lesion on 
T2 demonstrates peripheral rim of hypointensity and central 
hyperintensity 
with equivocal subtle enhancement on postcontrast images.  An 
associated 
apparent developmental venous anomaly is identified.  The 
constellation of 
findings would suggest a cavernous malformation, however given 
the equivocal 
enhancement and spiculated right lung nodule seen on prior 
examination, 
short-term followup is recommended to exclude metastatic 
disease. 
2. No acute intracranial infarct. 
3. Findings of age-related involutional changes with small 
vessel ischemic 
disease. 
4. 6 mm aneurysm at the right MCA bifurcation, better evaluated 
on recent 
prior CTA of the head. 

___ CXR
1. Increased interstitial markings in the right lung suggesting 
chronic 
infection or aspiration no focal consolidation. 
2. Unchanged moderate hyperexpansion. 
3. Known spiculated right upper lobe mass is not identified. 

___ LENIs
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right or left lower 
extremity 
veins. 

___ CTA chest
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism. 
2. Moderate centrilobular emphysema, upper lobe predominant. 
3. Significant endobronchial secretions at the level of the 
carina, extending to the right lower lobe leading to partial 
lobar collapse and significant mucous plugging, progressed since 
the prior CT from ___. Stable biapical scarring. 
5. Unchanged spiculated nodule in the right upper lobe (3:83), 
warrants close interval followup. 

___ CXR
In comparison with the in study of ___, there is little 
change in the 
prominent interstitial markings throughout both lungs, 
especially at the right base.  Extensive apical pleural 
thickening fibrosis is unchanged. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
On ___, the patient fell overnight. She was transferred to an 
OSH ED in the morning according to her son. Her CT head revealed 
a right IPH, and she was therefore transferred to ___ for 
further evaluation. Her CT/CTA showed a hyperdense rounded 
lesion in R temp lobe measuring 7mm and a 7mm hyperdensity in 
the internal capsule. CTA showed 6mm R M1 bifurcation. She 
additionally complained of left ankle pain, and was found to 
have a left fibula fracture. 

On ___, the patient's neurological examination was stable. She 
was fitted with an aircast boot for her left fibula fracture and 
was seen by physical therapy, who felt that she would benefit 
from an occupational therapy consult and additional ___. Pt had 
Brain MRI which showed that the R frontal lobe hyperdensity on 
recent head CT was most likely cavernous malformation but due to 
equivocal contrast enhancement with speculated R lung nodule, 
short term follow up MRI was recommended to exclude metastatic 
disease. The scan also showed small vessel disease and confirmed 
R MCA aneurysm. 

On ___, pt's neurologic exam was stable. OT was consulted and 
recommended acute rehab. Ortho had recommended aircast and WBAT 
as well as follow up with ___ clinic in 2 weeks. The patient 
complained of SOB and so CXR, CTA, and US were ordered.  CXR and 
CTA showed emphysema and a lung nodule.  LENIs were negative for 
DVT and CTA was negative for PE.

On ___, the patient remained neurologically and hemodynamically 
stable.  She continue to work with ___.  She had some confusion 
overnight and was likely sundowning as she is much more clear 
this morning.  She denies any HA, nausea, or dizziness.  She is 
currently stable and will be discharged to rehab this afternoon.

Brief Hospital Course:
================================
PRIMARY REASON FOR ADMISSION:
================================
___ yo F with a history of colon cancer, depression, anxiety, and 
a recent admission to neurosurgery ___ to ___ for fall, small R 
IPH, and L fibular fracture who is now readmitted from ___ 
rehab with altered mental status, found to have a RLL pneumonia. 


================================
ACTIVE ISSUES:
================================
# Altered mental status: The patient presented with altered 
mental status after recent discharge from neurosurgical service 
with IPH. On admission, she was oriented x1, disorganized and 
with loose associations. Repeat CT scan did not show any 
evidence of worsening bleed.  TSH, B12, and RPR were negative.  
She was found to have HCAP on chest imaging with clinical signs 
and symptoms of pneumonia (see below). With antibiotics, her 
mental status improved to A&Ox3 although she did have 
intermittent delirium and anxiety during hospital stay.

#HCAP: The patient had leukocytosis, productive cough, AMS and 
imaging consistent with pneumonia. She received 72hours of 
vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl and was transitioned to po 
levofloxacin (last day ___. She was evaluated by SLP and not 
felt to be at risk for aspiration.

#Hypoxia: The patient also developed a new oxygen requirement 
during admission of 2L, felt secondary to both HCAP and some 
pulmonary edema. She does not carry a diagnosis of congestive 
heart failure although did improve with 20mg IV Lasix. She was 
off of oxygen at the time of discharge. Would benefit from 
monitoring of O2 saturations and possible outpatient TTE.

#Lung nodule: Patient has 11mm  speculated R lung nodule seen on 
CT chest of ___ and CTA of ___. After discussion with the 
patient and her family, further workup will be deferred to the 
outpatient setting with her PCP.

#Diarrhea: Pt had 4x loose BM on ___ with WBC peaking at 17.0 
on that day. However afebrile, no abdominal pain, with stool C. 
diff antigen negative. With decrease in bowel regimen, her 
diarrhea improved.

================================
CHRONIC ISSUES:
================================
#IPH, R frontal cavernous malformation: Bleed stable on ___. 
She will continue keppra with outpatient Neurosurgery follow up.
 
#L fibula fracture: She should continue wearing her L ankle boot 
with physical therapy. 

#Depression: Home sertraline was continued. She may benefit from 
dose adjusting or adding another agent to help with anxiety. 

================================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
================================

options regarding further workup of her incidentally found R 
lung nodule (PET scan, CT-guided biopsy). Given clinical history 
and imaging, this is concerning for possible malignancy. 
Outpatient PCP is ___. Please make sure she has close follow 
up with Dr.  ___ ___
[ ] Patient is still intermittently confused despite improvement 
of her pneumonia, which per her family is not quite her baseline 
mental status pre-fall. She will need further follow-up to 
monitor and work up her mental status. Would recommend delirium 
precautions

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital for investigation of your 
confusion and change in your mental status. As you know, you 
were admitted to ___ from ___ to ___nd were 
discharged to ___ rehab. There, your caregivers were 
concerned that you were confused and behaving differently than 
usual, so you were transferred back to ___ for further care. 
Here, you had a head CT done that showed no change in the 
appearance of the blood in your brain from your fall, and a 
chest x-ray that showed a new pneumonia in your right lung 
(which was likely contributing to your confusion). You were 
started on antibiotics by IV (eventually changed to antibiotics 
by mouth) to treat your pneumonia. During your time here your 
breathing and cough improved and you also demonstrated that you 
were thinking more clearly as your pneumonia improved. 
Additionally, you were also given two doses of a medication 
called Lasix to help you urinate more and get rid of some of the 
extra fluid you had in your system, which also helped with your 
breathing.

As you know, during your prior hospitalization you had a CT scan 
of your chest that incidentally showed a nodule in the upper 
part of your right lung, which could potentially be cancerous, 
either from the lung itself or from elsewhere in the body such 
as the colon. This nodule was seen again during chest x-rays 
that you received during this hospital stay. You should follow 
up with your primary care physician to discuss options and make 
a plan for potentially getting more diagnostic studies of this 
nodule.

Thank you so much for allowing us to be a part of your care.

Best,
Your ___ Medicine Care Team

PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST (___): Lungs are clear 
without consolidation or pleural effusion. There is no 
pneumothorax. The heart size is normal. There is no hilar or 
mediastinal enlargement. Pulmonary vascularity is normal.  
Degenerative changes are noted in the spine. Surgical clips are 
present in the right upper quadrant. 

KUB (___): IMPRESSIONS: No evidence of radiopaque foreign 
body. Relatively gasless abdomen. 

CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS (___): IMPRESSION: 
1. Fatty infiltration of the liver. 
2. Bilateral renal cysts. 
3. No evidence of colitis or diverticulitis. 
4. Possible calcification within the ovary versus calcified 
fibroid.  
Non-urgent outpatient pelvic ultrasound could be performed for 
further 
evaluation. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
#. Nausea/vomiting/diarrhea: The patient's gastrointestinal 
symptoms had resolved by the night of her admission, and she 
experienced no further nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Given the 
rapid onset and rapid resolution of her symptoms with an 
unremarkable abdominal CT and high WBC count, she was believed 
to have suffered from gastroenterits, likely infectious from 
possible food source. Her elevated lactate level in the ED (4.5 
mmol/L) was believed to be secondary to dehydration and rapidly 
reversed with IV fluids.  She was discharged with a 5-day 
prescription for ciprofloxacin.

#. Syncope: Patient had unwitnessed syncopal event after having 
multiple loose BMs and n/v. Likely vaso-vagal episode in setting 
of severe dehydration from food-poisoning. She was monitored 
with telemetry and resuscitated with fluids and experienced no 
syncopal episodes during her stay.  No orthostatic hypotension.
.  
#. ARF: Ms. ___ baseline creatinine is roughly 0.7 but 
was elevated to 1.6 upon presentation. The etiology of the ___ 
was felt to be pre-renal given her copious vomiting and diarrhea 
and BUN/Cr ratio >20. Her creatinine gradually improved with 
fluid resuscitation to creatinine 1.1 just prior to discharge. 
Her quinapril and HCTZ were held due to her ARF.  She was 
discharged on her home medications, inluding her diabetes 
medication.
.  
#. Type 2 DM: The patient's blood glucose was initially 514 in 
the ED. She was given insulin and placed on an insulin sliding 
scale, which acheived appropriate blood sugar control. Her oral 
hypoglycemics were held due to her ___ and restarted on 
discharge.  
.  
#. CAD: Cardiac ischemia was ruled out by three sets of negative 
cardiac enzymes and an unchanged ECG. She was monitored on 
cardiac telemetry with no events. 
.  
#. Arthritis: Patient takes methotrexate on ___ and was 
admitted on a ___. She will decide with her doctors whether 
continuing ___ is appropriate.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ left-handed woman with hx of HTN,
DM, psoriatic arthritis, and sudden R hearing loss of unclear
etiology last fall who presents with transient confusion this
afternoon in the setting of a mild headache and nausea. She
reports that she woke up this morning with a mild bifrontal
headache, which is unusual for her. She also felt nauseated and
vomited once. She went back to bed and slept until ___. She
woke up and was going to call her friend but found that she 
could
not remember her number (although she calls her very

confused and ""didn't make sense."" She still had a mild headache
at the time but denies any changes in vision, dizziness,
weakness, numbness/tingling, difficulty walking. She called ___,
and by the time she arrived at the ED she was able to remember
the phone numbers she had been trying to think of and felt back
to baseline. She did have transient difficulty remembering the
name of one of her medications (glyburide). She estimates the
entire episode lasted about 45 minutes.

Currently she feels entirely back to normal except for a
continued slight headache. Her nausea has resolved. She denies
any changes in vision, dysarthria, dysphagia, lightheadedness,
vertigo, tinnitus or hearing difficulty. Denies difficulties
producing or comprehending speech.  Denies focal weakness,
numbness, parasthesiae. No bowel or bladder incontinence or
retention. Denies difficulty with gait.

On general review of systems, the pt denies recent fever or
chills.  No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain. Denies
cough, shortness of breath.  Denies chest pain or tightness,
palpitations. +Nausea/vomiting as above, denies diarrhea,
constipation or abdominal pain.  No recent change in bowel or

HEAD MRI:  There is no acute infarction, edema, mass effect, or 
evidence of
blood products in the brain parenchyma.  There are multiple 
small foci of high T2 signal in the subcortical, deep, and 
periventricular white matter of the cerebral hemispheres, 
nonspecific but likely sequela of chronic small vesselischemic 
disease in a patient of this age.  There is mild prominence of 
theventricles and sulci due to cerebral atrophy.  The major 
arterial flow voidsare grossly preserved.
 There is a small mucus retention cyst in the right maxillary 
sinus.  There ismild mucosal thickening in left lateral mastoid 
air cells.
 
HEAD MRA:  The intracranial internal carotid arteries are patent 
without
evidence of significant stenoses.  Bilateral M1 segments of 
middle cerebral
arteries are patent without evidence of stenoses.  The proximal 
inferior
division of the right middle cerebral artery appears smaller 
than the left. 
There are artifacts through this area on the source data 
bilaterally, yet this finding is asymmetric.  The A1 segment of 
the right anterior cerebral artery is hypoplastic, a normal 
variant.  Otherwise, bilateral anterior cerebral arteries appear 
patent without evidence of stenoses.  In the posterior 
circulation, the left posterior inferior cerebellar artery is 
not visualized.
No definited ___ complex is seen.  Bilateral vertebral 
arteries, basilarartery, right posterior inferior cerebellar 
artery, bilateral anteriorinferior cerebellar arteries, 
bilateral superior cerebellar arteries, andbilateral posterior 
cerebral arteries appear patent without evidence ofstenoses.  
The left posterior cerebral artery receives a large contribution 
from the left posterior communicating artery, but the left P1 
segment ispatent.  There is no evidence for an intracranial 
aneurysm.
 
NECK MRA:  The origins of the common carotid and vertebral 
arteries are not
adequately assessed.  Otherwise, the common carotid arteries are 
patent
without evidence of stenoses.  There is signal loss at the 
origin of the right internal carotid artery with an apparent 50% 
stenosis.  However, evaluation of the proximal internal carotid 
arteries is prone to artifacts when using the 2D time-of-flight 
technique.  The left internal carotid artery appears patent 
without evidence of hemodynamically significant stenoses.  The 
cervical courses of the bilateral vertebral arteries are patent 
without evidence of hemodynamically significant stenoses.
 
IMPRESSION:
1.  No acute infarction.
 
2.  Supratentorial white matter signal abnormalities are likely 
sequela of
chronic small vessel ischemic disease in a patient of this age.
 
3.  2D time-of-flight neck MRA demonstrates an apparent 50% 
stenosis at the
origin of the right internal carotid artery.  Since 2D 
time-of-flight
technique is prone to artifacts at the origins of the internal 
carotid
arteries, correlation with carotid sonography could be helpful 
to better
define the extent of stenosis.
 
4.  Apparent diminished caliber of the inferior division of the 
right middle cerebral artery compared to the left, which may be 
related to atherosclerosis.
 
5.  Nonvisualization of the left posterior inferior cerebral 
artery, which may be related to anatomic variation or occlusion.

EEG:This is an abnormal awake and sleep EEG because of nearly
continuous focal slowing in the left hemisphere, maximal in the 
left temporal region, and poorly sustained alpha rhythm on the 
left. These findings are indicative of moderate focal cerebral 
dysfunction in the left temporal region,possibly structural in 
origin. Mild independent focal slowing in the right temporal 
region is indicative of subcortical dysfunction of non-specific 
etiology. No epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures 
were noted.
 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ woman with a history of hypertension and
diabetes who was admitted to the Stroke Service with an episode 
of confusion and right hand numbness. 
She woke up yesterday morning with numbness of her right
hand (both palmar and dorsal surfaces).  This cleared up within 
a
couple of minutes.  However, she also had a dull headache at 
that
time, which lingered on for the entire day.  This was associated
with some nausea.  Later in the afternoon, the headache worsened
and she had considerable difficulty dialing in her friend.  She
looked at the number buttons, but simply could not
figure out how to dial in the number.  Eventually, she managed 
to
call another friend, who told her that she sounded confused. 
This lasted for about 20 minutes or so during which she had
another episode of right hand numbness.  Her exam had cleared up
by the time she was seen in the hospital.

Detailed stroke work-up including a brain MRI was performed for 
her, which did not show any infarct or significant vascular 
stenosis.  The MRA of the neck was normal. 
Performed EEG did not show any interictal discharge.
As the symptom subsided she was discharged home.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___, 

___ came to the ED with symptoms of difficulty with number and 
right hand numbness.  This occurred in the context of headache, 
so our differential diagnosis included stroke, seizure and 
migraine.  MRI was normal and EEG was obtained.  The latter 
result was also normal.  Given these findings and your symptoms, 
we feel that migraine with neurological symptoms ('complex 
migraine') was the most likely cause.  

We have increased your aspirin to 325 mg daily.  Please take the 
'enteric coated' form so that this is gentle on your stomach.

Please continue to weigh yourself every morning, call MD if 
weight goes up more than 3 lbs.

Imaging
==========
EKG ___
Baseline artifact. Sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality. Left 
bundle-branch block. Slow R wave progression in this context is 
non-diagnostic, as are ST-T wave abnormalities. Compared to the 
previous tracing of ___ heart rate is not as fast.  

Chest Xray ___
IMPRESSION:  Diffuse bilateral interstitial abnormality 
consistent with mild pulmonary edema or atypical pneumonia. 
Moderate cardiomegaly. 
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist. 


ECHO ___
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly 
dilated. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall 
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left 
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45 
%). The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic 
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral 
valve prolapse. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is an 
anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad. 


IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild left ventricular 
cavity dilation with mild reduction in systolic function. Cannot 
exclude regional variation given poor acoustic windows. Normal 
right ventricular cavity size and systolic function. 
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the left ventricular cavity is now mildly dilated. The other 
findings are similar.

EKG ___
Sinus rhythm. Left bundle-branch block. Compared to the previous 
tracing  
of ___ there are no significant changes.

Cardiac Cath ___
Findings
ESTIMATED blood loss: 5 cc
Hemodynamics (see above): BP very labile during procedure
Coronary angiography:  right dominant
LMCA: 
LAD:  40% mid with patent stent
LCX:  long 60% mid
RCA:  40% ostial in-stent restenosis, 80% mid
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo woman with CAD s/p  Velocity and ___ stents in ___ to 
the ostial and proximal RCA and mid LAD who presents in 
hypertensive emergency and LBBB (last seen in ___.

# NSTEMI - Patient noted to have troponin elevations in the 
setting of hypertensive emergency. She did not endorse any chest 
discomfort consistent with her prior MI in ___. She did have 
elevated troponin levels and an LBBB that had been noted in the 
past but not on most recent previous EKGs. She underwent cardiac 
catheterization which demonstrated an 80% lesion in the mid-RCA 
and a drug-eluting stent was placed.  Her echocardiogram 
demonstrated mild left ventricular dilation and systolic 
dysfunction. It was thought that this NSTEMI could be related to 
a demand event; however, given her persistent LBBB and troponin 
elevation, along with RCA lesion it was possible that she had a 
ischemic event. Her new medications were full dose atorvastatin, 
carvedilol, clopidogrel. Her simvastatin was discontinued, as 
was her metoprolol for these favored medications. Her quinapril 
was increased to 80mg daily from 40mg.
- She was setup with close follow up recommendation with her PCP 
and cardiologist.

# Hypertensive emergency: Patient presented in pulmonary edema 
in setting of hypertension. Given on and off symptoms past few 
days concerning for unstable angina especially with prior 
history of CAD. It was unclear what led to hypertensive 
emergency but patient states that she is not always compliant 
with her blood pressure medications, but even when she is 
compliant her BPs are in the 140s-150s. To control her blood 
pressure she was switched from metoprolol to carvedilol. Her 
quinapril was increased to 80mg daily from 40mg daily. On day of 
discharge her blood pressure maximum was 150s/80s, but primarily 
had been in the 120s/70s
- She should have her blood pressure closely monitored and 
medications adjust as needed for systolic blood pressure <130s.

# Acute on chronic systolic and diastolic dysfunction: This was 
from her hypertensive crisis. Patient was volume overloaded on 
admission with BNP of 2512. She was diuresed during her stay. On 
discharge her weight was 89.6kg from a weight of 92.1kg. She was 
sent home on a new diuretic of torsemide 10mg daily.

# LBBB: Patient has been noted previously to have intermittend 
LBBB. Last noted in ___. ECG without concordance. With symptoms 
of SOB concerning for anginal equivalent. As described above she 
underwent cath with intervention.

# UTI: Patient complained of dysuria. Her UA showed bacteria, 
wbcs, and leukocyte esterase positive. She was started on 
ciprofloxacin. Her UTI was pending at discharge. She was given a 
script to complete a seven day course of antibiotics.

# Elevated lactate: Function of distress from pulmonary edema. 
She improved to normal when her hemodynamics were well 
controlled.

# Diabetes mellitus type 2, uncontrolled. Her oral 
anti-hyperglyemics were switched to SQ insulin. She was 
continued on 10U of lantus nightly. Her glucose remained well 
controlled.

# Hyperlipidemia: Pt with good lipid panel on simvastatin 10 mg, 
but given secondary prevention, and NSTEMI her atorvastatin was 
increased to 80 mg

# CKD: Creatinine ranges from ___. She presented initially 
with mild volume overload. She was gently diuresed during her 
stay and her kidney function remained stable at baseline.

# Hypothyroidism: She appeared euthyroid and she was continued 
on Levothyroxine 125 mcg daily.

# Psoriatic arthritis: She was off treatment and had no symptoms

placed to mid-RCA; PCI of the LAD and RCA in ___ in the s/o 
NSTEMI as well), sCHF (EF 40-45%), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, 
and diabetes who was brought in by EMS after she was called ___ 
due to worsening SOB.

#CHF: Pt was found to be fluid overloaded and started on 
diuresis in the ED. Shortly after arrival to the floor, pt was 
triggered for acute dypsnea, and transferred to the CCU. She was 
aggressively diuresed, with symptomatic improvement. Over the 
course of the hospitalization, she was net negative >5L. At 
discharge, weight was 98.5kg. Pt note, pt's carvedilol, 
quinapril and torsemide were decreased in the setting of soft 
blood pressures.

#NSTEMI: On admission, pt was found to have a stably elevated 
tropons (0.24->0.31->0.29), concerning for possible NSTEMI. She 
was started on a heparin drip, but did not receive a 
catheterization immediately due to her acute-onset SOB. While in 
the CCU, she had a troponin elevation from 0.29->0.68. She 
underwent LHC on ___ and was found to have 85% stenosis or 
mid RCA and 99% in-stent stenosis in ostial RCA. DES was placed 
in the ostial RCA lesion. Post-procedurally, pt did well, and 
her SOB resolved. She was discharged with a plan to follow up 
with cardiology.

# ?Afib: Pt had a brief (<20 seconds) episode of wide complex 
rhythm while in the CCU, thought to be SVT with abberancy.

# Transaminitis: Pt was found to have slightly elevated 
transaminases on admission, felt to be secondary to congestive 
hepatopathy in the setting of NASH. Transaminases trended down 
in the setting of diuresis.

# HTN: Pt's carvedilol and quinapril were decreased during this 
hospitalization in the setting of soft blood pressures.

Patient was recently admitted to ___ from ___ - ___ for 
worsening SOB, and was found to have been fluid overloaded - was 
diuresed aggressively (for net negative >5L for LOS). During 
stay, trop-T acutely elevated, so patient underwent LHC on 
___, which revealed diffuse LCX disease (up to 85% 
stenosis), and 99% in-stent stenosis of ostial RCA s/p DES

___ at 13:00 today, at which point she was doing well. 
Afterwards, while lying down at home at 15:00, she acutely 
became dyspneic (no exertional component); EMS was called and 
found patient to be hypertensive 180/130, tachypneic into ___, 
O2 sat in ___ per EMS. Denied CP, medication noncompliance, ___ 
edema. Was placed on biPAP, and awas found to be doing better 
when she arrived to the ED. 

In the ED, patient continued on BiPAP, given SL nitro, and 
started on nitroglycerin drip, which improved dyspnea as well as 
blood pressure (180/130 -> SBP 110s). Work of breathing improved 
in ED course, but did not tolerate off-bipap trial. Given 40 mg

Brief Hospital Course:
___ with PMHx of CAD, systolic heart failure (EF 40-45%), 
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes, recently admitted 
for for flash pulmonary edema c/b NSTEMI (found to have 
thrombosis in RCA stent, s/p DES), who presented with acute 
dyspnea secondary to decompensated heart failure. Patient 
required ICU level of care with BIPAP, diuresed with IV lasix 
with improvement in respiratory status. Course complicated by 
type II NSTEMI, thought ischemia triggering heart failure 
exacerbations, now s/p DES to LCX. Patient was transitioned to 
oral diuretics with continued stable respiratory status. 

ACUTE MEDICAL ISSUES: 

#) ACUTE SYSTOLIC DECOMPENSATED HEART FAILURE (LVEF 35% on 
___: 
Patient with recent episode of flash pulmonary edema presenting 
with acute dyspnea and signs of volume overload on exam, 
elevated BNP 4802. Patient's coronary artery disease (LCx lesion 
up to 90% stenosis) and ischemic MR likely contributing to flash 
pulmonary edema. Patient initially required BIPAP and ICU level 
of care. Respiratory status improved with IV lasix (80mg) for 
diuresis. Additionally, patient underwent cardiac 
catheterization with DES to LCx. Patient transitioned to 
torsemide 40mg PO daily, quinapril 5mg PO daily, carvedilol 
6.25mg PO BID. Patient was breathing comfortably on room air on 
day of discharge, weight 85.6 kg

#) CAD, Type II NSTEMI: 
2-vessel (LCX and RCA disease), with LCX up to 90% stenosis, and 
RCA recently found to have in-stent stenosis now s/p DES on 
___. 
Patient presented with shortness of breath which has been 
previous anginal equivalent. EKG without ischemic changes, 
troponin elevated to peak 1.07, MB 19 concerning for demand 
ischemia in setting of decompensated heart failure. It also 
seems that ischemia may be trigger for patient's flash pulmonary 
edema. Patient underwent cardiac catheterization ___ with DES 
to LCx. RCA was not visualized during this catheterization as to 
avoid excess contrast exposure in patient with acute kidney 
injury. Patient continued on aspirin, statin, plavix, home dose 
carvedilol, and quinapril 5mg PO daily.  

#) Moderate MR: 
At least moderate mitral regurgitation per ECHO from ___. 
Etiology unclear, possibly from ischemic disease. LV cavity size 
appears normal, so less likely functional cause. Patient will 
need to follow up with outpatient cardiologist for further 
evaluation and potential treatment of mitral regurgitation. 

# Hypertension: 
Patient had soft blood pressures during recent hospitalization, 
and patient stated that her BPs over the last week have been low 
(120s). However, when found by EMS, patient had BP 180/130. 
Medication non-compliance unlikely. Acute hypertensive episode 
possibly related to acute anxiety/dyspnea and heart failure 
exacerbation. Patient resumed on home carvedilol 6.25 mg PO/NG 
BID, low dose quinapril 5mg PO daily. 

# Acute Kidney Injury: 
Cr 1.9 on admission (baseline 1.3 as of ___.  Possibly 
related to medications - patient taking 20 mg quinapril daily 
(instead of taking 5 mg daily), or due to torsemide that was 
recently increased from 5 mg to 10 mg daily. Additionally 
consider poor renal perfusion in setting of decompensated heart 
failure exacerbation. Started low dose  quinapril, 5 mg daily - 
as benefit from ACEi important in cardiac recovery. Will need to 
consider uptitrating quinapril if able as outpatient. Cr on 
discharge 1.7.  

# Dry cough / Rhinorrhea:
Patient symptoms thought to be viral prodrome as patient was 
afebrile and without productive cough making pneumonia unlikely. 
Blood and sputum cultures with no growth. As chest xray showed 
patchy R basilar opacity and white blood count rising, would 
continue to monitor clinically, if fevers or worsening symptoms 
consider treatment for pneumonia. At this time will treat 
patient symptomatically with benzonatate for cough. 

CHRONIC MEDICAL ISSUES:

# Diabetes: 
Treated with home dose 12U Lantus with additional humalog 
insulin sliding scale while inpatient.

# Hypothyroidism:
Continued home levothyroxine Sodium 125 mcg PO/NG DAILY

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___ 
___.   You were admitted to the hospital after 
placement of a stent in your carotid artery.  The stent will

in your groin, the puncture site heals on its own.  There are no 
stiches to remove. 

Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery
Carotid Artery Stent Discharge Information

Preventing a Blood Clot in the Stent
After getting a stent, you need to take aspirin and 
clopidogrel (Plavix) medicines that work to prevent blood clots 
from forming on the carotid stent.
Important: Do not stop taking aspirin and clopidogrel (Plavix) 
without discussing it with the doctor who did your carotid stent 
procedure. 

Puncture Site Care
For one week:
Do not take a tub bath, go swimming or use a Jacuzzi or hot 
tub.
Use only mild soap and water to gently clean the area around 
the puncture site. 
Gently pat the puncture site dry after showering. 
Do not use powders, lotions, or ointments in the area of the 
puncture site. 

You may remove the bandage and shower the day after the 
procedure.  You may leave the bandage off. 
You may have a small bruise around the puncture site.  This is 
normal and will go away one-two weeks. 
Call your doctor right away if you have swelling, bleeding, 
drainage or discomfort at the puncture site that is new or 
increasing.  Call if  leg or foot where the puncture was done 
feels cold, or if you have a temperature of 101 or more. 

Activity 
For the first 48 hours: 
Do not drive for 48 hours after the procedure
For the first week:
Do not lift, push , pull or carry anything heavier than 10 
pounds
Do not do any exercises or activity that causes you to hold 
your breath or bear down with abdominal muscles.   Take care not 
to put strain on your abdominal muscles when coughing, sneezing, 
or moving your bowels.
After one week:
You may go back to all your regular activities, including 
sexual activity.  We suggest you begin your exercise program at 
half of your usual routine for the first few days.   You may 
then gradually work back to your full routine.

To get help right away, call ___.
 
Call the surgeon right away for:
headache that is not controlled with pain medication or 
headache that is getting worse
fever of 101 degrees or more

Pertinent Results:
Intra-op TEE ___
Conclusions   
Pre-bypass rhythm: sinus rhythm with left bundle branch block

 PRE-BYPASS: 

 The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is 
normal. There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic 
dysfunction with visually estimated LVEF of ___. The basal 
inferior and inferoseptal segments are hypokinetic; the 
remaining basal segments contract normally. The mid inferior, 
inferoseptal, anteroseptal and anterior segments are 
hypokinetic. The mid anterolateral and inferolateral segments 
contract normally. The apical segments are severely hypokinetic. 
(True apex not visualized). Septal motion is consistent with 
known left bundle branch block. No masses or thrombi are seen in 
the left ventricle. Doppler parameters are most consistent with 
Grade I (mild) left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There 
are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are simple 
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve 
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are structurally normal. Mild-to-moderate (___) mitral 
regurgitation is seen initially, this decreases to mild at lower 
blood pressures. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial 
effusion. 

 POST-BYPASS:

 Rhythm: Atrially paced with left bundle branch block
 Infusions: Norepinephrine

 1. Left ventricular systolic function is slightly less vigorous 
(estimated LVEF is approximately 30%). Abnormal septal motion is 
more pronounced with more significant hypokinesis. Mid anterior 
wall hypokinesis is more pronounced than pre-bypass.
 2. Right ventricular function remains preserved.
 3. Mitral regurgitation is trace-mild.
 4. Remaining valvular function is unchanged.
 5. The thoracic aorta is intact following decannulation.

 Dr. ___ was notified of the findings at the time the exam was 
performed in the operating room.

Vanco trough ___: 19.4

CXR ___
In comparison the previous film, the cardiomediastinal 
silhouette is stable. There is no focal consolidation consistent 
with acute pneumonia.  There are small bilateral pleural 
effusions.  The PICC line terminates in the cavoatrial junction 
and there is a right IJ that terminates in the right atrium.  
There is no pneumothorax. 

___ Echo:
Pre-bypass rhythm: sinus rhythm with left bundle branch block
 PRE-BYPASS: 
 The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is 
normal. There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic 
dysfunction with visually estimated LVEF of ___. The basal 
inferior and inferoseptal segments are hypokinetic; the 
remaining basal segments contract normally. The mid inferior, 
inferoseptal, anteroseptal and anterior segments are 
hypokinetic. The mid anterolateral and inferolateral segments 
contract normally. The apical segments are severely hypokinetic. 
(True apex not visualized). Septal motion is consistent with 
known left bundle branch block. No masses or thrombi are seen in 
the left ventricle. Doppler parameters are most consistent with 
Grade I (mild) left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There 
are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are simple 
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve 
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are structurally normal. Mild-to-moderate (___) mitral 
regurgitation is seen initially, this decreases to mild at lower 
blood pressures. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial 
effusion. 
 POST-BYPASS:
 Rhythm: Atrially paced with left bundle branch block
 Infusions: Norepinephrine
 1. Left ventricular systolic function is slightly less vigorous 
(estimated LVEF is approximately 30%). Abnormal septal motion is 
more pronounced with more significant hypokinesis. Mid anterior 
wall hypokinesis is more pronounced than pre-bypass.
 2. Right ventricular function remains preserved.
 3. Mitral regurgitation is trace-mild.
 4. Remaining valvular function is unchanged.
 5. The thoracic aorta is intact following decannulation.

===========
Ms. ___ was admitted to the MICU for post-cardiac arrest 
care. She was treated with targeted temperature management and 
an EEG showed no evidence of epileptiform activity. After 
completing a targeted temperature management protocol, she was 
re-warmed and sedation was weaned for extubation. She was 
extubated on ___ after waking up and passing a spontaneous 
breathing trial, however was re-intubated later that day in the 
setting of desaturation to the ___. She also had persistent 
acute kidney injury with declining urine production. After 
several conversations with her nieces who are her healthcare 
proxies, the decision was made to initiate continuous renal 
replacement therapy in an attempt to optimize her for 
extubation. The patient underwent several more rounds of CRRT 
with removal of several liters of fluid. The patient underwent a 
trial of extubation on ___, which the patient did not 
tolerate, ultimately requiring reintubation for worsening 
respiratory function. During her trial of extubation, she had a 
likely aspiration event and spiked a fever to 101.8 and was 
started on ___. The patient's blood cultures were positive 
for GNR and plastic surgery and CT surgery were consulted who 
did not feel that the patient's sternal wound was the source of 
her bacteremia. The patient was persistently requiring multiple 
vasopressors to maintain MAPs of 65. Discussions with family on 
___ resulted in de-escalation of care. On ___ with the 
patients family present, the patient was extubated and 
officially made CMO. The patient expired on ___, surrounded by 
family.

neuropathy, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, schizophrenia, 
presents for syncope, found to be orthostatic. 

ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Syncope: Patient presenting with 3 episodes of syncope within 
the past week. Symptoms of lightheadedness and vision blacking 
out most consistent with orthostasis, proven by vital signs on 
morning of admission to the floor. She received 2L IVF and her 
recently prescribed nortriptyline was stopped (as were her 
antihypertensives). EKG and troponins were negative for 
ischemia, and she had no cardiac events on telemetry; neurologic 
exam was intact. 

# Borderline Thrombocytosis: Admission PLT 435, stable through 
hospitalization. Unknown etiology, no signs of infection to 
suggest reactive process, no current CBC findings to suggest 
proliferative disease. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:
# Diabetes Mellitus: Continued home Lantus with ISS while in 
house; held home metformin and liraglutide.
 
# Hypertension: Held antihypertensives were held as above.

# HLD: Continued home pravastatin.

# Schizophrenia: Patient gets IM Haldol injections every 90 
days, last due ___. Held this injection for outpatient 
consideration in setting of orthostasis because patient's 
daughter reported it makes her feel weak. She will follow-up 
with her outpatient providers. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Consider restarting amlodipine and losartan in the outpatient 
setting, as pressures will tolerated
- Nortriptyline was stopped during hospitalization as it may 
have contributed to her orthostatic hypotension
- Borderline thrombocytosis may be worked up as appropriate in 
the outpatient setting
- Consider adjustment of home diabetes regimen in the outpatient 
setting 
- Patient due for Haldol IM injection - instructed her and her 
family to follow-up with PCP ___ mental health providers

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to ___ 
because you had several episodes of darkening vision and passing 
out. We call these kinds of episodes ""syncope"".

While you were here, we did not find evidence of an infection. 
We also monitored your heart rhythm, which was normal. We think 
that the reason you passed out is because you didn't have a high 
enough blood pressure. We gave you some IV fluids and stopped 
your blood pressure medications, and you were better.

When you go home, please follow up with your primary care 
doctor, who can carefully restart your blood pressure 
medications. Until you see your primary care physician, please 
do not take amlodipine or losartan. Please do not take 
Nortriptyline either. 

Please return to our facility or another hospital if you 
experience chest pain, shortness of breath, or another episode 
of passing out.

Thank you for allowing us to care for you here,
Your ___ care team

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year-old man with a history of ___ 
disease w/ DBS device, who presented with slurred speech and a 
grossly positive UA consistent with a UTI. Patient triggered on 
arrival to the medicine floors for likely urosepsis.

ACUTE MEDICAL/SURGICAL ISSUES ADDRESSED:
# Toxic metabolic encephalopathy
# H/o ___ disease
Patient presented with somnolence without focal neurologic 
deficits. He had a Head CT without evidence of infection or 
acute pathology like stroke. Infectious workup was notable for 
pan-sensitive pseudomonas. Chest CT did not demonstrate any new 
consolidation that would be suggestive of a pneumonia. CNS 
infection was considered given acute mental status change and 
presence of DBS; however, patient returned to baseline mental 
status on second day of admission. His lethargy was ultimately 
believed to be due to sepsis, compounded by poor reserve given 
underlying ___ disease. He was started on broad spectrum 
antibiotics transitioned to ciprofloxacin on ___ as per urine 
culture to treat UTI.

# Urinary retention, foley 
# UTI
# Sepsis, presumed urinary source 
Patient presented with leukocytosis, fever and positive UA with 
indwelling foley in the setting of recent admission to ___ 
with sepsis from urinary source. Given history, urinary tract 
infection was thought most likely source. He was started on 
vancomycin and cefepime on upon admission. Foley catheter was 
replaced upon admission to the floor. His urine grew 
pseudomonas, that was pan-sensitive. He was discharged on 
ciprofloxacin to complete total 14 day course on ___. With 
regards to his urinary retention, he was continued on tamsulosin 
0.4mg PO daily and switched to oxybutynin 2.5mg PO BID. He had a 
trial to void ___. He produced ~100 cc and retained ~300cc urine 
with each attempt of urination over the course of the day. 
Straight catheterization was performed once for 500cc urine. 
Foley catheter was replaced prior to discharge secondary to high 
post-void residuals. He will follow up with urology on ___

Antibiotic course
- s/p Ceftazidime 2 g IV Q12H (___)
- s/p 1 day cefepime (___)
- s/p vancomycin 1g IV q8h (___)
- cipro (___)

# Tachypnea, Hypoxia
Patient triggered on arrival to floor on ___ for tachypnea, 
hypoxia. Initially concerning for respiratory compensation in 
the setting of acidosis from sepsis but lactate wnl without 
acidosis on VBG reassuring. No clear consolidation to suggest 
PNA but concerning for aspiration event in the setting of fever, 
AMS. Patient had no resp issues prior to discharge

#?GPC Bacteremia
___ bottles grew coagulase negative gram positive cocci in 
clusters. Believed to be contaminant. Patient was continued on 
Vancomycin until ___ when speciation resulted. 

CHRONIC ISSUES PERTINENT TO ADMISSION:
___ disease: Continued carbidopa-levodopa 3 tablets PO 
in morning, then 2 tablets q2h while awake and as needed 
overnight

#Anxiety: Continued bupropion 300mg PO daily. Held clonazepam 
0.5mg PO BID in setting of AMS.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
[ ] To complete 14 day course of ciprofloxacin for pseudomonas 
UTI (last day ___
[ ] Discharged with foley as failed trial of void w/ outpatient 
urology follow up.

CT HEAD ___:
There is acute left temporal subarachnoid and subdural 
hemorrhage.  The 
subdural blood along the left frontoparietal and temporal 
regions is 
relatively thin, with a maximal thickness of 4 mm at the left 
temporal 
convexity (02:10) and 5 mm at the anterior inferior temporal 
convexity 
(602b:59).  Foci of subarachnoid blood (602b: 65, 66, 68) are 
scattered within the anterior left temporal sulci.  There is 
mild left temporal sulcal effacement but no uncal herniation.  
Sulcal prominence is indicative of age related involutional 
change.  Periventricular and subcortical white matter 
hypodensities suggest chronic microvascular ischemia. No 
fracture or scalp abnormality.  The paranasal sinuses are clear. 
Incidental note is made of bilateral optic drusen is a.  
Otherwise, the orbits are unremarkable. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Following diagnosis of her Intracranial Hemorrhage and Right 
Clavicular Fracture, the patient was noted to be substantially 
hypertensive in the ED (hypertensive urgency vs. emergency with 
SBP > 200). She was transferred to the ICU for monitoring and BP 
control for which she received a short course of IV Nicardipine. 
She had a good response and was weaned off the drip and placed 
on her home antihypertensive medications. The Neurosurgery team 
was also consulted in the ED for additional recommendations 
regarding her Left SAH and SDH. They recommended against any 
additional imaging and that her SBP should be < 160 mm Hg. She 
was transferred to the surgical floor for further care. 

Once on the floor, she was able to tolerate a regular diet, 
ambulate independently, void and demonstrate appropriate bowel 
function. Her right clavicular pain was controlled with pain 
medications by mouth only. Her blood pressure stabilized on her 
home medications and she was instructed that she should have 
close follow up with her PCP for adjustments in her 
anti-hypertensive regimen. She was given the appropriate 
medications and discharge instructions and was sent home.

is getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon. 
 
 o You will receive a prescription for pain medicine to take by 
mouth. It is important to take this medicine as directed. o Do 
not take it more frequently than prescribed. Do not take more 
medicine at one time than prescribed.  
 o Your pain medicine will work better if you take it before 
your pain gets too severe.  
 o Talk with your surgeon about how long you will need to take 
prescription pain medicine. Please don't take any other pain 
medicine, including non-prescription pain medicine, unless your 
surgeon has said its okay.  
 o If you are experiencing no pain, it is okay to skip a dose of 
pain medicine.

normal EGD to duodenum
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ h/o developmental delay, DM, HTN, and chronic right great 
toe osteomyelitis currently on 12 weeks of antibiotics presented 
with weakness, anorexia and unintentional weight loss found to 
have acute on chronic anemia and hypercalcemia. 

#Acute on chronic anemia - Hgb drop to 7.9 on ___ from 9.3 on 
admission and a previous baseline of 11 associated with dark 
guaiac positive stools. Also with reported difficulty swallowing 
and significant unintentional weight loss. Underwent EGD on 
___ but without obvious source of bleed. Prep for colonscopy 
was started but complicated by ileus and then further difficulty 
prepping due to refusal to take in mag citrate.  As such, and 
with stable hct and guaic negative stool, colonoscopy was 
cancelled.  Alternative etiologies were considered, including 
the antibiotics for his toe infection and thus these were 
changed to augmentin.  Recommend continued monitoring with CBC 
outpatient. 

#Ileus - While prepping for colonoscopy he developed an ileus.  
Prep was stopped and colonoscopy was cancelled.  He was started 
back on a bowel regimen with resolution of ileus and improvement 
in bowel movements.  He never had abdominal pain, nausea or 
vomiting, even with ileus.  He will require aggressive bowel 
regimen, as constipation may in part be causing his symptoms of 
decreased appetite and anorexia.

#Unintentional weight loss - no e/o occult malignancy on CT 
Torso, passed SLP eval. Etiology was likely related to 
antibiotics, given time course, or to chronic constipation, with 
fecal load on admission ct and ileus.   

#Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus with recent hypoglycemia - initially 
hypoglycemic on presentation and was hydrated with D5LR but 
transitioned off after finger sticks were noted to be > 200. His 
home diabetic medications were held on admission and he was 
continued on QID finger sticks with Humalog Sliding Scale as 
well as low dose lantus insulin. A1C 6.9%. 

HLD - He was continued on his outpatient Atorvastatin but held 
his Aspirin in the setting of acute on chronic anemia with 
concern for acute gastrointestinal bleed.  Resume aspirin 
outpatient with stable hemoglobin. 

#Osteomyelitis of hallux of right great toe - on 12 week course 
of outpatient antibiotics (through ___ followed by 
Infectious Disease and Podiatry clinics here at ___. He was 
continued on his home oral Ciprofloxacin and Bactrim per 
outpatient regimen that was changed to single agent augmentin 
___ as trial to improve appetite.  He will need to follow up 
with outpatient ID ___.

#HTN - antihypertensives initially held on admission due to 
normotension.  However, at discharge he became hypertensive and 
discharged on valsartan and metoprolol; amlodipine can be 
resumed outpatient if he remains hypertensive.
 
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
-ID follow up for osteomyelitis
-Monitor blood pressure and adjust antihypertensive regimen. 
-Resume aspirin if hemoglobin stable.

___, T2DM c/b neuropathy, osteoporosis, hip fracture, TBI in
___ with SDH presents as code stroke

He was last known well around ___ today, when he was seen 
waking
up at his group home. He was then taken to his adult day care.
Around 0900 or so, the exact time is not clear, an employee at
his facility tells me that he saw that when he came out of the
van that was dropping him off, he was leaning to the left in his
wheelchair and had a left facial droop.  At baseline he is
reported to be oriented to self only. The employee called ___ and
nursing over, who assessed him, and then arranged for him to be
transferred here for further evaluation. The employee has never
noticed L sided weakness like today or a L facial droop. He
states that the patient's speech and mental status seemed at
baseline currently and when he first saw him today. At baseline
patient uses a wheelchair to get around. When I asked the 
patient
why he was at the hospital, he replied that he ""fell down"" and 
is
unable to provide more detail about what happened. Patient was
hospitalized here in ___ on the neurosurgery service after 
he
was found down at his group home and found to have TBI w/ EDH vs
SDH on imaging. This has been noted to have reabsorbed on follow
up CT in ___. In review of other notes, it does not appear
that he was ever documented as having any left facial asymmetry.

His discharge exam from neurosurgery o ___ was listed as
""Moving BUE spontaneously and independently - ___ in strength
Moving BLE spontaneously and independently and equally : ___

He follows with Dr. ___ at ___ neurology, who he last saw
in ___. His stroke in ___ were characterized by the
following symptoms per Dr. ___: ""witnessed sudden
decrease in interaction, where  his speech was arrested, 
possibly
even dysarthric and mumbled, and then he fell to the right.  His
eyes were open during this time, but no deviation or any
tonic-clonic activity or incontinence was observed.   He had a
negative CT and preliminarily negative CTA of the head and neck. 

Further testing was recommended, including MRI and EEG.  MRI
showed a small, probable late acute to early subacute infarct in
the right parietal periventricular white matter, as well as more
extensive chronic small vessel ischemic disease and moderate
diffuse brain atrophy.  His EEG showed theta slowing but no
epileptiform activity.""

unresponsiveness, requiring intubation for airway protection. 
Extensive workup, including EEG and MRI brain, was unremarkable, 
and the presentation was likely metabolic encephalopathy due to 
Proteus UTI. He improved with antibiotics, and completed a 
ten-day course of treatment in house. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
======================
[ ] Monitor BPs, as they were repeatedly elevated. He was 
started on losartan and uptitrated to 75mg qd, where his BPs 
seemed well controlled.
[ ] Please copy-frward the ""disposition planning"" section from 
below for any future admission notes, given logistical 
difficulties with his discharge.
 

ACUTE ISSUES:
=======================
# Toxic metabolic encephalopathy: 
# Proteus mirabilis Urinary Tract Infection 
# Delirium
He was admitted to the ___ intensive care unit, given 
altered mental status and initial unresponsiveness. MRI without 
contrast at ___ did not show any acute intracranial 
pathology. cvEEG showed generalized slowing consistent with 
encephalopathy, without evidence for seizures or epileptiform 
discharges. Patient's electrolytes and CBC were within normal 
limits. Urine culture at ___ grew Proteus, sensitive to 
ceftriaxone and amoxicillin. He was initially started on IV 
ceftriaxone, and transitioned to oral Augmentin, with 
improvement in mental function. Renal ultrasound and abdominal 
x-ray were completed, given multiple Proteus infections and 
associated with nephrolithiasis, however both were within normal 
limits. The patient was briefly observed in the neuro ICU then 
transferred to medicine for further care. His mental status 
gradually improved with the treatment of UTI, and was at the 
baseline (per his group home) by time of discharge. 

#Hypercarbia: 
End-tidal CO2 elevated to 70 at presentation to ___. 
However, the patient was extubated and maintained adequate 
respiratory status prior to transfer to ___. CXR within normal 
limits. Unclear etiology, but the patient maintained adequate 
SpO2 on RA with normal work of breathing while hospitalized at 
___.

#Troponemia: 
Troponin was initially elevated to 0.2 at ___, but on 
repeat here, downtrended to 0.09 then 0.08. EKG within normal 
limits. Possibly secondary to demand ischemia in the setting of 
urinary tract infection, given acute onset of encephalopathy. 

# Hypertension: 
Continued metoprolol 12.5mg BID. BPs have been elevated during 
admission, and he was started on losartan during this admission, 
and discharged on losartan 75mg daily.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at the ___ 
___!  

WHY WAS I IN THE HOSPITAL?  
==========================  
- You were admitted because you were unresponsive and very 
confused.

WHAT HAPPENED IN THE HOSPITAL?  
==============================  
-You were admitted to the neurology intensive care unit, and a 
breathing tube was placed to protect your airway.  The breathing 
tube was successfully removed; however, you were still confused. 
 You underwent head imaging, which was not concerning for a 
sudden process, including a seizure.  However, you were found to 
be growing bacteria in your urine, and we gave you antibiotics.  
It is likely that your confusion was due to this urinary tract 
infection.

WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I GO HOME?  
================================  
- Be sure to take all your medications and attend all of your 
appointments listed below. 

We wish you the best!

Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.

 
Discharge Instructions:
* Your injury caused left/right 6th rib ___ rib fractures which 
can cause severe pain and subsequently cause you to take shallow 
breaths because of the pain.
 
* You should take your pain medication as directed to stay ahead 
of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep breaths. If 
the pain medication is too sedating take half the dose and 
notify your physician.
 
* Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures.  In order to 
decrease your risk you must use your incentive spirometer 4 
times every hour while awake.  This will help expand the small 
airways in your lungs and assist in coughing up secretions that 
pool in the lungs.
 
* You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to hold 
against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing and 
deep breathing.
 
* Symptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short 
periods may ease the pain.
 
* Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you 
should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid 
and fiber intake if possible.
 
* Do NOT smoke
 
* If your doctor allows, non-steroidal ___ drugs 
are very effective in controlling pain ( ie, Ibuprofen, Motrin, 
Advil, Aleve, Naprosyn) but they have their own set of side 
effects so make sure your doctor approves.
 
* Return to the Emergency Room right away for any acute 
shortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation 
around your ribs (crepitus).

Please call your doctor or nurse practitioner or return to the 
Emergency Department for any of the following:
*You experience new chest pain, pressure, squeezing or 
tightness.
*New or worsening cough, shortness of breath, or wheeze.
*If you are vomiting and cannot keep down fluids or your 
medications.
*You are getting dehydrated due to continued vomiting, diarrhea, 
or other reasons. Signs of dehydration include dry mouth, rapid 
heartbeat, or feeling dizzy or faint when standing.
*You see blood or dark/black material when you vomit or have a 
bowel movement.
*You experience burning when you urinate, have blood in your 
urine, or experience a discharge.
*Your pain in not improving within ___ hours or is not gone 
within 24 hours. Call or return immediately if your pain is 
getting worse or changes location or moving to your chest or 
back.
*You have shaking chills, or fever greater than 101.5 degrees 
Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius.
*Any change in your symptoms, or any new symptoms that concern 
you.

Please resume all regular home medications, unless specifically 
advised not to take a particular medication. Also, please take 
any new medications as prescribed.

Please get plenty of rest, continue to ambulate several times 
per day, and drink adequate amounts of fluids. Avoid lifting 
weights greater than ___ lbs until you follow-up with your 
surgeon.
Avoid driving or operating heavy machinery while taking pain 
medications.

To the Rehab:
Thank you for participating in the care of this patient.  This 
patient has had multiple teaching sessions with both the 
Wound/Ostomy nurses and with the staff nurses and should have a 
good idea of how to care for their own ostomy.  They have also 
been given several items that will assist them in their own 
care, such as instruction sheets, ostomy supplies, and ostomy 
output measuring tools.  However, we would like to stress a few 
important points to assist you in the care of this patient.

Bowel Function:  
Ø  It is important to encourage the patient to monitor their 
bowel function closely every day.  The patient should continue 
to record their ileostomy output (as much as physically 
possible) and the amount of fluid they have taken in, just as 
they were taught in the hospital.  A urinal or hat should be 
used to record their ostomy output daily.  
o   The patient has been taught to use a daily measurement chart 
to record their I&Os.  This chart should be continued to be 
used at least until their follow-up appointment. If their ostomy 
output is less than 500 ml or greater than 1200 ml of liquid 
stool in a day, it is very important to call the doctors office 
with this information. 
o   Continue to reinforce to the patient that the major risk 
with an ileostomy is dehydration related to fluid loses. Daily 
fluid intake is ___ glasses of fluids, including electrolyte 
enhanced beverages.  In the hot weather, encourage them to take 
in increased amounts of fluid and closely measure their 
ileostomy output.  
o   Watch for signs and symptoms of dehydration including: dry 
mouth or tongue, decrease in urination, urine darker in color, 
dizzy when he/she stands, cramps in his/her abdomen or legs, 
dizziness, increased thirst, or weakness.

There is no abnormal enhancement or enhancing mass.  There is no 
other 
evidence of hemorrhage or infarction.  The ventricles are normal 
in size.  
There is mild mucosal thickening of bilateral maxillary sinuses 
with a small right ethmoid mucosal retention cyst.  The orbits 
appear unremarkable. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
1. Small rounded focus of hemorrhage within the left 
frontoparietal operculum corresponding to prior CT findings.  In 
the setting of trauma and given the adjacent soft tissue 
swelling, finding may represent intraparenchymal hemorrhage.  
Possibility of an underlying cavernoma is not entirely excluded. 

2. No other evidence of intraparenchymal hemorrhage or 
infarction. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted for monitoring to the Neurosurgery 
Service.  He was started on Keppra for seizure prophylaxis with 
a 7 day course.  Overnight he remained neurologically intact.  
He underwent MRI on ___ to evaluate for underlying mass or 
cavernoma as the shape of the hemorrhage on head CT was 
suspicious for underlying lesion.  MRI was negative for mass but 
could not exclude cavernoma and so plan is for follow up with 
outpatient imaging in 3 months.

At the time of discharge the patient was tolerating a regular 
diet, ambulating without difficulty, afebrile with stable vital 
signs.

unwitnessed fall w/ +head strike. CT Head revealed a 6mm IPH. CT 
neck, CT chest, CT abdomen/pelvis revealed no fractures or acute 
intra-abdominal process. Additionally, he was noted to be in new 
renal failure (baseline sCr: 1.1) with a sCr: elevation to 2.6.  
A foley catheter was placed for urine output monitoring. The 
patient was admitted to the Trauma Surgery service and 
transferred to the TICU for neurologic evaluation.  The patient 
was confused, but alert and able to follow commands. 

On HD1, Neurosurgery was consulted and recommended Q2H neuro 
checks, a repeat head CT without contrast 8 hours after his 
initial head CT, Keppra 500mg BID x 7 days, holding subcutaneous 
heparin x 24 hours, HOB > 30 x 24h.  On HD1, lactate improved 
from 8.5->3.8, Cr 2.6->2.2. 

On HD2, the patient was transferred to the surgical floor. The 
patient was written for and tolerating a regular diet.  Pain was 
controlled with prn tramadol and acetaminophen. Repeat head CT 
was stable and subcutaneous heparin was ordered. 

On HD3, the patient's creatinine had returned to his baseline of 
1.1, his foley catheter was removed, he voided without issue and 
IV fluids were discontinued. The patient was restarted on home 
medications.  The patient's blood pressures were soft with SBP 
___, so home Lasix and lisinopril was held, metoprolol 
tartrate was written for 25mg BID with holding parameters.  
Physical and occupational therapy were consulted and the patient 
was approved to go home with outpatient physical therapy 
services and follow-up in concussion clinic.  

The patient remained stable from a cardiac and pulmonary 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary 
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were 
encouraged throughout hospitalization. The patient's intake and 
output were closely monitored. The patient's fever curves were 
closely watched for signs of infection, of which there were 
none. The patient's blood counts were closely watched for signs 
of bleeding, of which there were none. The patient received 
subcutaneous heparin and ___ dyne boots were used during this 
stay and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as 
possible.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
and hemodynamically stable.  The patient was tolerating a diet, 
ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  The patient received discharge teaching and 
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and 
agreement with the discharge plan.  Home physical therapy and 
visiting nursing services were established. Report was given to 
the RN at the patient's PCP office and the hospital discharge 
summary was faxed.

HTN, who was transferred from ___ because of concern for 
intracranial hemorrhage.  

The patient reportedly fell down at ~8pm on ___ after he lost 
his balance when he was transitioning to a couch. He was walking 
with a walker, and the fall was witnessed by wife. He was too 
weak to get up from the floor. He was able to crawl to the rug 
where he slept o/n because he didn't initially want EMS to help 
him up. ___ found down on ___. Patient initially went to 
___, and was sent to ___ due to concern of hematoma 
in the brain surrounding known brain metastasis. Patient denies 
head strike, neck pain, back pain, numbness, tingling or 
weakness which is new. No chest pain or shortness of breath.  

In the ED, initial vitals were: T97.6 72 142/78 18 97% RA.

fx or dislocation. CXR at ___ was without any evidence of a 
cardiopulmonary process. Patient was given: Keppra 500, CTX 1g. 
Neurosurgery was consulted, and recommended continuing home 
keppr. They reported that the bleed was likely a spontaneous 
brain hematoma unrelated to fall. They recommended no surgery, 
follow-up with previously scheduled brain tumor appt. 
 
This morning, patient was mildly confused and had difficulty 
answering questions. He was AAOx2. He knew the location, and the 
state in which he was located. He was unable to report what 
brought him to the hospital.

IMAGING/STUDIES
==============
___ XRay of Tibia/Fibula:
No acute fracture or dislocation of the left tibia or fibula.

___ CT C-Spine:
No acute fracture or malalignment. 

___ Left Foot XRay:
There has been prior amputation of portions of the third through 
fifth metatarsals. There is cortical irregularity involving the 
distal stump of the third metatarsal and there is an adjacent 
soft tissue ulcer. This is suspicious for osteomyelitis however 
comparison to old films would be helpful to establish if this is 
an interval change. Degenerative changes of the midfoot are 
identified. There is an inferior calcaneal spur. Degenerative 
changes of the second PIP joint are also present.

___ Lower Extremity Arterial Exam:
Normal resting right ankle-brachial index with moderately 
decreased resting left ankle-brachial index indicative of left 
peripheral vascular disease.

___ EEG:
This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of 
(1) focal slowing and a relative loss of faster frequency 
activity on the left side, indicative of focal cerebral 
dysfunction; (2) continuous, semi-rhythmic delta admixed with 
polymorphic theta activity in the background, indicative of a 
moderate etiologically-nonspecific encephalopathy. There are no 
pushbutton events. There are no electrographic seizures or 
epileptiform discharges.

___ CTA Head and Neck:
1. Hemorrhagic left occipital metastatic lesions, better 
characterized on recent prior MR examination. Additional smaller 
lesions as previously characterized, are not well seen on CT 
examination. Confluent areas of left-greater-than-right white 
matter hypodensity likely reflect a combination of vasogenic 
edema and posttreatment changes.
2. No new hemorrhage or acute large territorial infarct.
3. Severe left and moderate right narrowing of the V4 segments 
of the vertebral arteries as well as mild narrowing of the 
bilateral intracranial internal carotid arteries. Otherwise 
patent intracranial arterial vasculature without occlusion or 
aneurysm formation. 
4. 20% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery by NASCET 
criteria. Otherwise patent cervical arterial vasculature without 
high-grade stenosis, occlusion, or dissection. 
5. Paranasal sinus disease, as described. Near complete left 
mastoid and middle ear cavity opacification and mild right 
mastoid air cell opacification which can be seen in the setting 
of mastoiditis/otomastoiditis. 
6. Increase in size of a 15 mm spiculated right upper lobe lung 
nodule. 
7. Interval increase of matted soft tissue density extending 
from the left hilus to the AP window, suspicious for progressive 
metastatic disease. 
8. Unchanged enlarged right hilar lymph node measuring 18 x 11 
mm.

___ MR HEAD W/ W/O CONTRAST: IMPRESSION:  
1. Stable multiple enhancing lesions in keeping with the 
patient's known history of metastatic brain disease, with the 
largest lesions in the left occipital and left cuneus containing 
internal hemorrhagic content with peripheral enhancement. 
2. No evidence of new lesion or abnormal enhancement.  No 
evidence of acute infarction. 

___ KUB: IMPRESSION: IVC filter in place.
 
___ BILAT LENIS: IMPRESSION:  
Extensive deep vein thrombosis of the left lower extremity from 
the common femoral vein extending at least to the popliteal 
vein.  Calf veins not well seen bilaterally. Right calf veins 
not well seen.  Otherwise, no evidence of deep venous thrombosis 
in the rightlower extremity veins.

HTN, PE s/p IVC Filter s/p fall, found to have likely 
spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage and LLE DVT. 

# Acute encephalopathy with R-sided weakness: Altered mental 
status that first started on ___ is most likely 
multifactorial given vasogenic edema from hemorrhagic brain 
lesion, as well as hospital delirium and was exacerbated by 
steroid-induced psychosis. On code stroke NCHCT ___ showed 
vasogenic edema likely surrounding the metastatic lesion. vEEG 
wet read without evidence of seizure, MRI brain without any new

   RAPID PLASMA REAGIN TEST (Final ___: 
      REACTIVE. 
      Reference Range: Non-Reactive. 

   QUANTITATIVE RPR (Final ___: 
      REACTIVE AT A TITER OF 1:2. 
      Reference Range: Non-Reactive. 

STUDIES:
___:
Cardiac perfusion: IMPRESSION:
1. Normal myocardial perfusion.
2. Normal left ventricular cavity size and systolic function.
Compared with prior study of ___, there is no significant 
change.

CT head w/o contrast: IMPRESSION: 
1.  Punctate hyperdensity along the right frontoparietal 
convexity may
represent a small amount of extra-axial hemorrhage versus 
artifact.  No
appreciable mass effect or intracranial edema.  Consider 
follow-up CT head for further assessment.
2.  Right frontal subgaleal hematoma without underlying skull 
fracture.
3.  Moderate age related involutional changes and evidence of 
chronic small
vessel ischemic disease.

CT Torso: IMPRESSION:
1. Acute left third, fifth and sixth rib fractures.  No 
pneumothorax. 
2. Focal widening of the intervertebral disc space at T10-T11 
anteriorly.  
This raises concern for other underlying ligamentous injury, the 
acuity of 
which is uncertain. 
3. Moderate amount of simple free intraperitoneal fluid which 
may be due to patient's peritoneal dialysis.  No other findings 
to suggest acute 
intra-abdominal injury. 
4. Hyperdense lower pole left renal lesion 

EEG (___):
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU EEG monitoring 
study because of mild diffuse background slowing, indicative of 
a mild encephalopathy, which is nonspecific with regard to 
etiology. No focal, lateralizing or epileptiform discharges are 
present. Compared with the prior day's recording, the posterior 
dominant rhythm is somewhat more well-sustained, indicative of 
improving encephalopathy 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ M PMHx significant for ESRD on PD undergoing w/u for 
transplant, HTN, DM, HLD, Ulcerative Colitis, BPH, h/o DVT on 
Coumadin initially presenting ___ MVC on ___ w/etiology c/f 
syncope found to have rib fractures and extra-axial hemorrhage 
s/p eval by neurosurg and was admitted to ___ w/hospital course 
c/b refractory HTN. Transferred to medicine for syncope 
evaluation, management of ESRD on PD, HTN.

x) Extra-axial hemorrhage, multiple left-sided rib fractures: 
His GCS was 15 on admission but there was a small hyperdensity 
on CT head concerning for possible bleed, so neurosurgery was 
consulted. Head CT repeat was waived since he was awake and 
alert and we could follow his neurological exam, which remained 
intact throughout his course. Per neurosurgery, his warfarin was 
held. His CT c spine was negative and his C-collar was cleared 
in the ICU. There was some anterior widening on T10-T11, but no 
tenderness on exam so an MRI was not pursued to rule out 
ligamentous injury. He was closely monitored with no change in 
neuro status. He was discharge on subcut heparin with plan to 
follow up with his ___ clinic as an outpatient. 

x) Syncope: unclear etiology. Per patient's description, he had 
no memory of approx. 10minutes leading up to the accident and 
does not remember the accident itself. Although it was 
originally thought that the patient was expulsed from the car, 
review of video of the scene showed the patient getting out of 
the care before collapsing. Differential included hypoglycemia 
given patient was NPO for cardiac testing although patient 
states he decreased his nighttime insulin and had a donut after 
his test vs hyperglycemia given donut vs hypertensive 
encephalopathy given patient was >200 SBP at cardiac testing vs 
seizure given late latent syphilis vs medication-induced given 
patient does not feel he received the ""reversing medication at 
the end of a stress test"" although review of the record shows 
amophylline was administered. He was monitored on tele with no 
events. He had an EEG which showed no seizure activity. Patient 
was noted to be hypoglycemic in AM on home dosing so his ___ 
lantus was decreased to 26U (from 30U). In addition, while in 
the TICU his blood pressure was extremely difficult to control, 
requiring the addition of nifedipine and IV hydralazine PRN. On 
the floor patient was restarted on home medications and was 
normotensive. Given overall negative work-up, patient was 
instructed to not drive a car for at least 6 months and to 
obtain clearance by his PCP. He will follow-up with his PCP as 
an outpatient. 

x) ESRD/PD, currently being w/u for transplant: Patient uses 
cycler at home with 6 exchanges with 2.5% dextrose. In hospital 
renal dialysis was consulted. He was continued on his home PD 
schedule, was on a strict bowel regimen with lactulose, 
senna/Colace, and miralax, and continued on home nephrocaps, 
calcitriol, and sevelamer.

x) HTN: As above, patient's BP was difficult to control while in 
TICU, possibly ___ to not receiving normal PD. However, evidence 
of uncontrolled HTN as outpatient given SBP >200 recorded during 
stress test. Per renal, goal SBP 140-160, and BP should not be 
lowered too quickly. On the floor he was continued on his home 
labetalol, Lasix, losartan, clonidine with stabilization of BPs. 


x) DM, type 2: As above, patient was noted to have low fasting 
fingersticks on home 30u lantus. This was decreased to 26u with 
no further episodes of hypoglycemia. He was maintained on ISS 
while in hospital. 

# Hx DVT: unclear if provoked, thought to be ___ to 
thrombophlebitis during previuos admission, and was on Coumadin 
as outpatient. Per neurosugrery recommendations, his Coumadin 
was held in hospital given small head bleed. Given risk of clot, 
patient was started on subcut heparin. He will follow-up with 
his ___ clinic x1 week after injury (___) to resume his 
Coumadin. 

Transitional Issues:
# CODE:  Full (confirmed by ___
# CONTACT:  ___ (wife) ___
[] Epogen injection was planned for ___ not given in 
hospital
[] RPR reactive at titer of 1:2, continue to monitor 
[] Coumadin held in setting of extra-axial hemorrhage, on subcut 
heparin with plan to restart ___ with ___ 
___
[] BP was difficult to control in hospital and he was 
transiently on nifedipine; transitioned back to home meds and 
was in 140s/60s. 
[] CT A/P showed ""Hyperdense lower pole left renal lesion for 
which dedicated imaging is suggested, preferably by multiphasic 
CT."" - needs follow-up imaging

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital after a car accident during 
which you lost consciousness. You were found to have rib 
fractures and concern for a small bleed in your head. You were 
evaluated by the Neurosurgery team who felt no interventions 
were needed and you were monitored closely. You should continue 
to take Tylenol ___ every ___ hours as needed for your pain. 
In addition, due to concern for bleed your Coumadin was held. 
You should continue to give yourself injections with heparin and 
follow-up with your ___ clinic to restart your 
Coumadin this ___. 

Because it was not clear why you lost consciousness, a full 
work-up for potential causes was performed. You had an EEG to 
monitor your brain which was normal and showed no evidence of 
seizure activity. Your heart was monitored on telemetry which 
showed no arrhythmias. Your blood sugars were monitored closely 
and your blood pressure was controlled with your home 
medications. It is important to check your blood sugars before 
every meal because you had some low sugars in the hospital. Your 
nighttime dose of lantus was decreased to 26U. If your sugars 
are <70 before meals, please do not give yourself your 4U lispro 
at that time. Because of the unknown cause of this episode, it 
is important you do not drive a car for at least 6 months given 
the high risk of a dangerous accident. After that time, you 
should follow-up with your primary care doctor for clearance.  

Thank you for letting us be a part of your care!
Your ___ Team

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted to the Neurosurgical Service from the 
OSH after patient experienced a mechanical fall with head strike 
and sustained multiple intracranial hemorrhages. 

On ___ Patient remained neurologically stable. Repeat CT head 
revealed expected evoluation. ICP bolt was placed for ICP 
monitoring. Hypertonic saline as started given increased 
cerebral edema. 

On ___, the patient's HTS gtt was increased to 35cc/hour 
overnight. His AM serum Na was 149. Neurologic checks were 
liberalized to every 2 hours. Given ICPs within the normal 
range, it was determined the hypertonic saline gtt would be 
weaned. Serum Na levels were continued to be checked every six 
hours. 

On ___, the patient remained neurological and hemodynamically 
stable. His 3% gtt was weaned off. A repeat head CT was obtained 
and showed a stable hemorrhage with increased cytotoxic edema. 
His ICP bolt was removed, ICPs prior to removal were less than 
10. There were plans for an MRI today but the patient started 
following simple commands. Will hold off MRI for now. 

On ___ the patients neurologic exam was stable: Eyes closed, 
LUE squeezes hand/localizes, LLE wiggles toes to command 
intermittently and localizes, RLE withdraws, RUE no movement. 
Sodium was slowly trending down to 150.  He underwent a 
bronchoscopy w/ BAL of RLL given increased secretions. This was 
overall clean, no purulence, no plugs. Foley was replaced for 
urinary retention. 

On ___ vent wean was attempted and ultimately the ICU team did 
not want to attempt to extubate, plan to wait until ___ 
because if does not tolerate will not re-intubate. He had a Tm 
of 102.5 overnight and cultures were sent. He did not follow 
commands in the evening and was febrile again. started on 
nafcillin based on BAL results. 

On ___ he was following commands x 4, exam was stable, and 
weaning the ventilator as tolerated.

On ___, the patient remained neurologically stable on 
examination. He was up to the chair with assistance. 

On ___, the patient remained neurologically stable on 
examination. His morning serum Na was 159. Free water flushes 
were increased. Dr. ___ met with the family and a 
discussion was held surrounding his prognosis. It was determined 
he would continue with full care and his neurologic checks were 
changed to every 4 hours. 

On ___, the patient's neurologic examination was slightly worse. 
The EEG showed multifocal epileptiform discharges and was 
recommended to continue LTM for another day. Cefepime was 
changed to Zosyn since it can lower seizure threshold. He 
underwent a bronch for BAL.

On ___ the patient neuro exam was poor but stabile, not 
following any commands. EEG showed worsened multifocal 
epileptiform periotic discharges, no seizure activity but 
concerning for high risk for developing seizures. Neurology was 
consulted for evaluation of adding a second antiepileptic 
medication. They believe the EEG changes are secondary to 
underlying structural brain abnormalities and did not recommend 
any changes to AEDs at this time. He was ordered for MRI/MRA to

History of Present Illness:
HPI: ___ is a ___ old man with a history of HTN,
dyslipidemia, alcoholism who suffered a severe TBI on ___ and
retuns today with worse mental status and new jittering
movements. 

Mr. ___ was discharged from ___ to ___ on ___. At that
point, he was able to identify his family, answer simple
questions (though attention was limited), name objects, spell
words, recognize his friends in photos and follow most commands.
He was moving all extremities, with some weakness in his R-side,
but not remarkably different from his left side.  

He appeared to decline in terms of his speech, his 
responsiveness
and his interactions two days ago. He also became more unsteady
and started having kicking, jittering movements of his arms and
legs. These were more noticeable when he seemed angry or
frustrated. 

These jittering, kicking movements are never rhythmic, they are
never stereotyped and he seems to continue to look around or 
make
eye contact when this is happening. He will sometimes kick one
leg, and other times both his legs. He will sometimes move both
his arms and other times just one arm. There were reports that
Keppra was not given at ___, but the MAR indicates that he
actually has been receiving it. 

On ___, Mr. ___ was found down on the driveway,
intoxicated. His CT demonstrated extensive IPH, IVH and SAH.
Initially during the admission his cerebral edema was treated
with hyperosmolar therapy, which was weaned off as he improved.
About a week into his admission, he was noted to be more
somnolent and was not following commands. This was in the 
setting
of intermittent fevers (VAP and klebsiella UTI). An EEG showed
multifocal epileptiform discharges, but no seizures (___). 
An
MRI on ___ showed new L ACA infarcts likely secondary to
subfalcine herniation and compression. He ultimately improved 
and
had a PEG placed on ___. He was discharged to ___ five
days ago (___). He was discharged on 1000 mg BID Keppra.

IMAGING/STUDIES: 

CT HEAD ___. Interval increase in size of the bilateral lateral 
ventricles, and third ventricle, most likely related to cortical 
volume loss   
2. Diffuse bifrontal, left temporal, and right cerebellar 
hypodensities, are likely sequelae of patient's prior multi 
compartmental hemorrhage, with subtle areas of increased density 
along periphery of left frontal lobe, and left temporal lobe 
possibly due to adjacent cortex or cortical laminar necrosis. No 
definite evidence of new intracranial hemorrhage. 

EEG ___
This is an abnormal video-EEG monitoring session due to the 
presence of a disorganized background characterized by fast 
activity with 
admixed delta slowing which is more prominent bifrontally. This 
finding is 
consistent with a moderate encephalopathy that is nonspecific 
with regard to etiology. Two of the patient's typical events of 
bilateral arm/leg nonrhythmic tremors are captured. There is no 
epileptiform activity on EEG or changes in heart rate at those 
times. There are no epileptiform discharges or electrographic 
seizures. 

MRI HEAD ___. Interval decrease in the size of the subacute hemorrhagic 
contusions in the bilateral frontal, left temporal, right 
occipital, and right cerebellar hemisphere with marked interval 
decrease in the surrounding edema and local mass effect. 
2. Interval decrease in the subarachnoid hemorrhage within the 
occipital horn of the left lateral ventricle and tiny subdural 
hematomas along the posterior falx and bilateral occipital 
lobes. 
3. Interval resolution of the restricted diffusion in the left 
anterior 
cingulate gyrus and splenium of the corpus callosum and 
decreased size of the areas of restricted diffusion in the 
bilateral posterior parietal lobes, representing the sequela of 
trauma. 
4. No new hemorrhages or acute infarctions. 

CT ABD/PELVIS ___. Small amount of free intraperitoneal gas in the upper 
abdomen.  No evidence of bowel perforation.  Free gas may be 
secondary to the placement and/or leak of gastrostomy tube, 
although this was placed on ___. 
2. AVN of the bilateral femoral heads. 

CXR ___
ET tube tip is 3.5 cm above the carina.  Since the prior study 
there has been development of widespread parenchymal opacities 
concerning for pulmonary edema.  Superimposed infection is a 
likely possibility as well.  Heart size and mediastinum are 
unchanged in position.  There is no appreciable pleural effusion 
or pneumothorax demonstrated. 

CXR ___ 
Compared to chest radiographs ___.  
Previous severe pulmonary edema continues to clear, with mild to 
moderate 
residual.  There is no appreciable pleural effusion or evidence 
of pneumothorax.  Heart size normal.  ET tube in standard 
placement

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ old man s/p extensive TBI with IPH, IVH 
and SAH 1.5 months ago presenting with a dramatic decline in 
mental status and verbal output in the last ___, along with 
intermittent jerking/kicking movements of his extremities. His 
exam on admission was significant for possible R facial weakness 
and intermittent kicking/jerking movements that were 
dyssynchronous and nonrhythmic. He did not have any verbal 
output and did not follow any commands. His course was 
complicated by hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring 
intubation, likely due to aspiration and mucus plugging, which 
resolved. At discharge, his encephalopathy had substantially 
improved, as he became interactive and conversational with no 
right sided weakness. 

# Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: On ___, on morning 
rounds, he was noted to be tachypneic to the ___, pale, and 
using accessory muscles. SBP 160s. His SpO2 was 80% on RA, and 
his lungs were rhonchorous, R>L. He still had the new murmur 
(see below), and his HR as in the 1ow 100s and irregularly 
irregular. Palpation of the LLQ of his abdomen elicited a 
grimace. He was non-verbal with eyes open, he was regarding the 
examiner, but he as not following commands. He was put on NC, 
and an ABG was obtained: 7.42/29/70/___/-3. TFs held. His SpO2 
remained 85 on NC, so he was put on a NRB with Sp02 91-92% 
initially. A stat CXR was ordered, which showed widespread 
parenchymal opacities suggestive of pulmonary edema vs. 
infection. His AM labs were pending, but later found to be 
stable. His wife was updated, and she reversed his code status 
from DNR/DNI to DNR/okay to intubate. Shortly thereafter, his 
face became cyanotic, his SpO2 dropped to the ___, and his body 
started shaking. At one point, his the pulse ox read 15%, but 
this was likely a false reading. A code was called, and he was 
intubated. The patient was transferred to the ICU for medical 
management. His respiratory failure was thought to be secondary 
to aspiration pneumonia vs. flash pulmonary edema in the setting 
of afib with ___. The patient was diuresed with IV Lasix and was 
ultimately extubated on ___. There was a low index of suspicion 
for infection, thus antibiotics were held. HR was controlled as 
below. Following transfer to the floor, he had several episodes 
of tachypnea with desaturation into the ___, requiring 
supplemental oxygen and transfer to the medicine service. He was 
given nebulizers, dexamethasone d/t concern for laryngeal edema 
post extubation, and Lasix d/t suggestion of pulmonary edema on 
CXR. However, a TTE did not reveal any diastolic dysfunction, 
and furosemide was ultimately discontinued given low suspicion 
for pulmonary edema (as well as a rise in his creatinine). CXR 
also showed new opacities concerning for aspiration, so his tube 
feeds were discontinued. His respiratory status improved, but he 
still required oxygen, so a chest CT was obtained, which showed 
bronchiectasis, mucus plugging, and ground glass opacification 
in the dependent regions of the right lung. His hypoxemic 
respiratory failure was ultimately thought to arise from mucus 
plugging and aspiration pneumonitis. He remained afebrile with 
no leukocytosis, so he was not thought to have aspiration 
pneumonia. He was taken by ___ for a conversion of PEG to GJ tube 
to decrease his probability of developing aspiration pneumonia. 
His oxygen requirement resolved, and he was discharged on room 
air with no tachypnea.  

# Hypoactive delirium: MRI showed expected evolution of prior 
TBI. EEG for more than 24 hours showed slowing but no evidence 
of seizures. A toxic-metabolic work-up only revealed mild 
hypernatremia to 146. UA was positive from foley, but the UCx 
only grew yeast. Repeat UA was also positive (also from old 
___). Foley replaced. Additionally, he had an area of erythema 
on his RUE that was initially concerning for possible 
cellulitis. He as initially treated with ceftriaxone, and then 
vancomycin was added. ID was consulted, and they recommended 
discontinuation of antibiotic and said yeast in urine as 
contaminant. An LP was done, and the mild pleocytosis and mildly 
elevated protein was thought to be c/w his known TBI ( 4 WBC, 9 
WBC, 17 RBC, 3 RBC, prot 104, gluc 41, lymphocyte ___, OP 
12). He was treated with empiric acyclovir while his HSV and VZV 
were pending. These studies were negative and acyclovir was 
discontinued. His Keppra was decreased from 1g BID to ___ BID to 
try to avoid sedating medication effects. Additionally, 
toxicology recommended discontinuation of trazadone. TSH was 
4.7, T4 was within normal limits. Cdiff neg. RPR and Lyme were 
negative. Quantiferon was indeterminate. During this period, his 
mental status waxed and waned, but he was intermittently able to 
be oriented to name, hospital (but not ___, and month (but 
not year), and he was able to follow midline and some 
appendicular commands. After resolution of his hypoxia, he 
became more alert and interactive.

# Upper airway obstruction secondary to crusting: When asked to 
cough on command, he had an explosive cough despite a hypophonic 
voice. Additionally, his wife mentioned recent thrush. ENT was 
consulted to look at his vocal cords, and they were noted to be 
normal (___). After extubation, the patient was noted to 
have significant upper airway sounds, so ENT was again 
consulted. He was found to have substantial dryness and 
crusting, which was partially obstructing his airway. ENT 
removed the material, and he was placed on humidified oxygen, 
and his breathing improved. He was discharged with follow-up 
with ENT in ___ weeks.

# Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: He was noted to have new onset 
AF on ___ ___s a previously undocumented murmur. A TTE 
showed normal global and regional biventricular systolic 
function. Mild aortic stenosis. Mild mitral regurgitation. Mild 
pulmonary hypertension. The patient was evaluated by 
neurosurgery who said that anticoagulation would be acceptable, 
if indicated. The patient was initially maintained on his home 
labetolol 400mg TID for rate control, but as his HR remained in 
the ___, his labetolol was discontinued. Given his CHADs-vasc 
score was 3, so he was started on warfarin due to moderate-high 
risk of thromboembolism.  His warfarin was uptitrated to 5mg 
daily on ___ given persistently subtherapeutic INR of 1.1.  Pt 
will need repeat head CT once INR therapeutic to rule out IPH.  

# Chest pain secondary to reflux: The patient endorsed 
substernal burning chest pain on ___. An EKG was normal with 
no ST/T changes. Troponins were negative x 2. His chest pain was 
thought to reflect GERD, and his famotidine was switched to 
lansoprazole disintegrating tabs. 

# GI: Pneumoperitoneum was seen on CXR and CT abdomen, but was 
thought to be related to related to PEG tube placement. The 
patient was evaluated by ACS who said no intervention was 
indicated. Abdominal exam was monitored and remained stable. 

# Nutrition: The patient's PEG tube was converted a GJ tube. Due 
to weight loss, his tube feeds were switched to Jevity 1.5 at 60 
ml/hr with addition of thiamine. Due to refeeding risk, his 
electrolytes were closely monitored. 

#Renal/Hypernatremia: Na of 146 treated with free water flushes, 
transitioned to D5W while intubated and NPO, restarted on free 
water flushes once extubated. Sodium was normal at 138 on 
discharge.   

# ID: as above

# Heme: noted to have anemia with high-normal MCV.  B12 and 
folate were normal. Iron studies showed anemia of chronic 
disease.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to ___ because you seemed more confused, 
with less interaction with those around you, as well as new, 
unusual movements. An evaluation for possible infection or 
metabolic abnormalities was negative. However, while in the 
hospital, you developed difficulty breathing, which required 
intubation. You were ultimately extubated, and your breathing 
improved. We think your breathing difficulties arose from 
aspiration, in which fluid from your gastrointestinal tract was 
going into your lungs. You were also seen by ENT, who removed 
dry crusting material from your throat, which we think was 
blocking air from getting to your lungs. When your breathing 
improved, you also became less confused, so we think these 
aspiration events were also causing your unusual behavior at 
admission. During hospitalization, you also developed atrial 
fibrillation, which caused your heart to beat irregularly. Due 
to this arrhythmia, we put you on a blood thinner, as atrial 
fibrillation can cause clots to form, which can then travel to 
your brain. Although you had a recent bleed in your brain, your 
neurosurgeon thought it was safe for us to start this 
medication. 

You are being discharged to rehab to help you recover from your 
traumatic brain injury. 

It was a pleasure taking care of you. 

Your ___ team

PERTINENT STUDIES
===============================
CT HEAD (___)
1.  Acute intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the left frontal 
lobe as described detail above, measuring 2.8 x 1.6 cm on the 
axial plane, with surrounding vasogenic edema. No significant 
mass-effect.
2.  Unchanged slightly prominent ventricles and sulci for 
patient's age, although this finding is nonspecific suggest mild 
cortical volume loss.
 
CT C-SPINE (___)
1.  No acute fracture or traumatic subluxation.
2.  Multilevel degenerative changes throughout cervical spine, 
more significant from C3-C4 through C6-C7 levels.
 
CT HEAD (___)
Stable acute intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the left frontal 
lobe,
measuring 3.0 x 1.3 cm on the axial plane, previously 2.8 x 1.6 
cm.  The
difference is likely secondary to positioning and 
redistribution.
Unchanged left posterior parietal calvarial fracture.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with history notable for schizophrenia, EtOH use disorder, 
polysubstance use, and type II diabetes who initially presented 
for fall while intoxicated c/b traumatic left frontal lobe 
intraparenchymal hemorrhage, managed conservatively. Details of 
hospitalization as follows:
 
# ACUTE LEFT FRONTAL INTRAPARENCHYMAL HEMORRHAGE
Initially brought to the ED by ambulance after found intoxicated 
outside with injuries related to fall. Initial workup was 
notable for CT head demonstrating acute intraparenchymal 
hemorrhage within the left frontal lobe consistent with 
traumatic brain injury. He was admitted to the neurosurgery 
service for monitoring and initiated on levetiracetam seizure 
prophylaxis for 7-day course. Hemorrhage was stable on repeat CT 
head the following day with continued plan for conservative 
management. He worked with physical and occupational therapy 
over the course of admission and was able to return to baseline 
level of function. He will follow up with neurosurgery in 
approximately one month with repeat CT head at that time.
 
# SCHIZOPHRENIA
Longstanding history of complex psychiatric illness complicated 
by chronic homelessness and polysubstance use. With history of 
suicide attempts and psychiatric hospitalization. On arrival he 
reportedly expressed thoughts of self harm, however, this was in 
the setting of acute EtOH intoxication, therefore limiting 
psychiatric assessment. Once sober he consistently denied any 
desire for self harm or suicide. He did not meet criteria for 
___ or inpatient psychiatric admission.
 
# ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE
Intoxicated on arrival with self-reported use of up to 1L vodka 
per day. He was monitored on CIWA with only minimal scores 
(primarily driven by headache in setting of head injury). 
Counseled on options for EtOH dependence treatment however he 
was not interested in seeking further care at this time. Started 
on folate, thiamine, and multivitamin. 
 
# THRUSH
Noted on arrival exam. HIV was negative on ___. Treated with 
clotrimazole x14 day course.
 
# HOMELESSNESS
Through coordination with social work he was discharged with 
plan for ongoing services and referred to the ___ program.  
He plans to stay at the ___.
 
# HYPOMAGNESEMIA
In setting of chronic alcohol dependence. Improved.
 
# TYPE II DIABETES
A1c 8.6. Resumed home metformin prior to discharge.
 
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
=================================
[ ] Will need repeat CT head at time of neurosurgery follow up 
in 4 weeks.
[ ] Will need ongoing assistance with services related to 
psychiatric disorders, EtOH dependence, and homelessness.

systolic hypertension. Biatrial enlargement.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o F with CAD ___ stents, PAF on coumadin, HTN transferred 
from OSH for management of C. difficile septic shock.  She was 
profoundly volume overloaded but stable off pressors and 
non-invasive ventilation.  
.
#C. diff - she was no longer septic upon arrival.  Per ID recs, 
pt was treated w po Vancomycin, last day ___. Pt does have 
diarrhea still but was seen by ID again, who felt that it is 
unlikely to be from Cdiff and recommended discontinuing vanc on 
___. Cdiff X3 on ___ and ___ have been neg.  Diarrhea 
may be secondary to tube feeds.  Should pt have any change such 
as fever, abdominal pain, worsening diarrhea, please check ___ 
toxins again
.
# CHF: Came in with acute on chronic diastolic CHF and profound 
fluid overload.  Echo showed nl LVEF but Mild AR, mod MR, mod 
TR.  Pt was placed on lasix gtt and diuresed aggressively. when 
transferred to the floor, pt did not have any edema on exam, she 
still had persistent but improving pleural effussions, and lasix 
had to be briefly held, as by labs she appeared volume 
contracted.  Pt has now been restarted on lasix 20mg po BID, 
which should be adjusted based on clinical status. Please follow 
___ periodically  to ensure pt is not developing acute renal 
failure

#AFib - In MICU, she developed afib with RVR.  Received 5 IV 
lopressor then had HR in the ___ transiently.  Pt had one other 
episode of transient asymptomatic bradycardia during sleep noted 
on tele. Pt was loaded with IV amio in MICU and now on amio 
200mg QD. Oral metoprolol has slowly been titrated and pt has 
tolerated it well. On floor, pt's HR remained in 100-110's at 
baseline w/ occ 130-140's w/ actitivty. Metoprolol should be 
continued to be titrated as long as bp allows. Pt has both Afib 
and hx of DVT and is being transitioned w lovenox to coumadin. 
Coumadin was increased from 2 to 3mg QD on ___, INR yesterday 
was still 1.2. Please titrate coumadin for a goal INR of 2.0-3.0 
and discontinue lovenox when INR therapeutic. 
.
# LOWER GI BLEED:
In the MICU, the patient was noted to have a small amount of 
blood clots and liquid blood in the rectal tube.   Lovenox and 
coumadin were temporarily held, although aspirin was continued.  
NG lavage was performed and was negative.  The GI service was 
consulted and deferred a colonoscopy.  Ultimately, it was felt 
that her bleeding may have been from the rectal tube.  Received 
1u pRBC on ___.  Hct stable thereafter without any further GIB.  
Pt was restarted on lovenox and coumadin on ___.  Pt's H/H 
remained stable on the floor but gradually drifted down from 25 
to 22. Given that pt has CAD, it was decided to transfuse 2 
units pRBC the day before transfer to ___ Rehab hospital. Pt's 
HCT appropriately rose from 22 to 30 on day of discharge.

#Cough - Pt has productiver cough w/ whitish sputum but has 
remained afebrile w nl WBC. CXR continues to show stable B 
pleural effussions. Pt will need ipratropium (avoid albuteral 
given afib) nebs and frequent suctioning to clear secretions. Pt 
was needing 2L oxygen and sats were 96-99% on it. 

#CAD - many risk factors, but low clinical suspicion for an 
event.  Trop only mildly elevated.  She was on ASA.  Lisinopril 
was discontinued to allow uptitration of metoprolol and should 
be started when bp allows.

.
#Hx of HTN - pt's bp gradually improving, was borderline in the 
90-100's before. Pt on metoprolol and lasix. Once metoprolol has 
been titrated, if bp allows, ACE-I should be started given CAD  
.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is an ___ female with PMH as listed above who 
presents with septic shock. 

1)Septic shock: Patient presented with hypotension, tachycardia, 
leukocytosis which was consistent with diagnosis of septic 
shock. She started having increasing amounts of diarrhea at the 
rehab facility and her urine was noted to be dark, concentrated, 
and foul smelling at rehab. She was recently admitted to ___ 
MICU for sepsis ___ c.diff. On admission, sepsis protocol was 
initiated. She was pan-cultured and started on broad spectrum 
antibiotics-Cipro, Vancomycin IV, PO Vancomycin, and Flagyl. The 
c.diff toxin came back positive. Her antibiotic regimen was 
weaned down to Flagyl IV and PO vancomycin. She should continue 
Flagyl for ___nd she should continue the Vancomycin 
PO which should be tapered over the next few months. 
Vancomycin taper as follows:
125mg PO four times daily for 6 days (last dose q6hrs is on 
___
125mg PO twice daily for 7 days
125mg once daily for 7 days
125mg every other day for 7 days
125mg every 3 days for 14 days

2)Diastolic CHF: Patient has history of diastolic CHF and 
required aggressive diuresis with a lasix gtt during her last 
admission. Cardiac enzymes were negative. She initially appeared 
volume overloaded on exam but is likely intravascularly dry 
based on her CVP since she presented with sepsis. Her Lasix was 
held given her hypotension and then restarted. She was restsrted 
on her home lasix regimen of lasix 20mg PO BID.

3)Atrial fibrillation: Patient first diagnosed with afib w/RVR 
during last admission. She is also anticoagulated with Coumadin. 
On admission, she was restarted on Amiodarone. The beta-blocker 
was held in light of her hypotension but then restarted after a 
few days. Anti-coagulation was also held given the 
supratherapeutic INR and coumadin 1.5mg PO daily was restarted 
today when her INR was 2.1 (see details below).

4)Anemia: Baseline hematocrit per OMR is low to mid 30's. She 
was transfused 2 units pRBCs in light of her hypotension. She 
was also maintained on iron supplements. Her HCT has since been 
stable.

5)Coagulopathy: Patient presented with elevated INR on 
admission. Remains elevated on transfer to medical floor. Likely 
___ antibiotics she had received. She was restarted on coumadin 
1.5mg PO daily today and should have daily INRs while at rehab 
given her c. diff history, amlodipine, and antibiotic regimen.

6)Non anion gap acidosis: Likely ___ diarrheal losses and she 
appears to be compensating based on the pH. Her bicarbonate 
level was followed daily. 

7)Hypertension: Her outpatient anti-hypertensive regimen was 
initially held given hypotension and sepsis. The beta-blocker 
was restarted after her hypotension resolved.  On several 
occasions in the last few days we have administered her 
beta-blocker despite SBP in the high ___ in order to control her 
heart rate as she has A fib and diastolic heart failure.

Brief Hospital Course:
Urosepsis: Ms ___ was found to have a pan-sensitive E Coli 
growing in her blood and urine along with a pan-sensitive 
Klebsiella growing in her urine.  She was treated with 
Ceftriaxone and transitioned to ciprofloxacin while in house.  
Case was discussed with ID and they recommended a 2 week regimen 
for transient bacteremia.   Given her prior history of severe 
clostridium difficile infection and intermittent loose stools 
during this admission, we decided to empirically treat her with 
PO vancomycin over 4 weeks (with a 2 week overlap period 
following discontinuation of ciprofloxacin) despite a negative C 
diff toxin.  During her hospital course, she improved 
significantly with antibiotics and remained afebrile.  The loose 
stools were improving by the time of discharge.  She was 
scheduled with her primary care doctor for follow up.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted because you were having shaking chills. You 
were found to have bacteremia, or bacteria in your blood, that 
probably came from a urinary tract infection. This was treated 
with antibiotics, which you will need to continue as an 
outpatient.  The medicine we are using to treat these bacteria 
is called ciprofloxacin.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of ___  
Hyperinflated lungs consistent with emphysema.  No evidence of 
focal 
consolidation or pneumothorax.  Small left pleural effusion 
versus pleural 
thickening. 

KNEE (2 VIEWS) LEFT Study Date of ___  
Left, distal perihardware femoral fracture is not significantly 
changed from ___.  Large layering knee effusion consistent 
with lipohemarthrosis. 

TTE ___
The left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is 
normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF = 
75%). The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. Right 
ventricular chamber size is normal with borderline normal free 
wall function. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is 
likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid 
regurgitation.] There are three aortic valve leaflets. The 
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is 
moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). Mild 
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
moderately thickened. There is severe mitral annular 
calcification. There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve 
chordae. There is mild functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 
6 mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification. Severe (4+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There 
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Significant 
pulmonic regurgitation is seen. The end-diastolic pulmonic 
regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery 
diastolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion. 
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. 
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the 
presence of elevated right sided pressures. 
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
aortic stenosis is worse (now moderate); multiple other major 
valvular lesions persist without major change.  

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of ___

fall. Seen by Neurosurgery, not found to have focal neuro 
deficits, held ASA for one week, repeat NCCTH was stable. Pt was 
cleared by home and ___ Cardiology for possible Ortho surgical 
repair of fracture, decided on casting and rehab. Afib w/RVR 
controlled w/IV Metop, transitioned to home dose Metoprolol and 
was stable.

# Left Femur Fracture: Pt suffered a left distal femur fracture 
after what was thought to be a mechanical fall at home, was 
initially admitted to the acute trauma surgical service, though 
later transferred to medicine due to her medical complexity. Pt 
was seen by Orthopedics, originally considered to be nonsurgical 
candidate, but after d/w ___ Cardiologist Dr. ___ 
inpatient ___, pt was cleared for surgery, though after much 
discussion, pt and husband decided on casting instead of surgery 
due to not dissimilar possible outcomes and surgical risk. Pt's 
left leg was casted by Ortho, was seen by ___ at ___, and will 
continue rehab at ___. Pain was controlled with Oxycodone and

# AFib: Pt w/hx of AFib, was not on anticoagulation, also pt 
w/severe MR and mild AS per TTE on ___ and known ___. She was 
found to be in RVR w/stable BPs in the ED. She was given IV 
Metoprolol which stabilized her Afib and transitioned to PO 
Metoprolol. Pt's home dose was unknown, though turned out to be 
Metoprolol Succinate 75mg qd, pt still suffered several bouts of 
RVR which resolved when pt placed on equivalent home dose of 
Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg q8h. Her home Lasix 20mg qd and home 
ASA 81mg qd were held.
 
# HTN: Pt was not currently on home BP meds on admission 
w/exception for Lasix 20mg qd. Has known AAA (3 cm). Pt's BPs 
were on the lower end for most of her admission and her home 
Lasix was held, pt was occasionally given IVF over her 
admission, had no signs of fluid overload and didn't develop 
SOB.

# ICH/Head Strike: Pt hit her head when she mechanically fell, 
was found to have a subdural hem, Neurosurgery was consulted, 
they found no focal Neurological deficits. Repeat NCCTH was 
stable, no interventions were recommended, although her home ASA 
was held for 1x week. Pt will f/u w/Neurosurg as outpatient.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to ___ from an outside hospital after you 
fell in your house and hit your head and broke your left leg. 
You were found to have a small, stable bleed in your brain. Your 
atrial fibrillation was found to be out of control and your 
heart was beating very fast. You were seen by our Neurosurgeons 
and we stopped your aspirin for a week due to your bleed, our 
Orthopedic surgeons evaluated you and recommended a cast to help 
repair your left leg fracture, and your heart rate got under 
control with medication. After your leg was placed in a cast, 
you were discharged to rehab for physical therapy.

Contrast administered through the G-tube demonstrates 
opacification of the 
stomach and duodenum, without evidence of leak.  No free air is 
identified.  A normal bowel gas pattern is seen.  There is a 
moderate amount of colonic stool. 

___ EGD:
Esophagus: Normal esophagus. 

Stomach:  
Contents: A PEG was found in the stomach body / antrum junction 
- this was in good position and not causing obstruction.  
Mucosa: Normal mucosa was noted in the whole stomach - the 
pylorus was widely patent. Cold forceps biopsies were performed 
for histology.  

Duodenum:  
Excavated Lesions A few superficial ulcers ranging in size from 
3 mm to 5 mm were found in the duodenal bulb.  

Impression: Foreign body in the stomach body
Normal mucosa in the whole stomach (biopsy)
Ulcers in the duodenal bulb
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum 

Recommendations: Await pathology results
No findings on upper endoscopy to explain patient's symptoms.
Return patient to hospital ward. Follow-up with inpatient GI 
consult service. 

PATHOLOGY:
==========
___ Biopsy:
1. Stomach, biopsy:
- Corpus mucosa within normal limits.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old woman with past medical history significant for lung 
cancer s/p thoracic surgery, and radiation injury necessitating 
G-tube placement, who presented from ___ for inability to 
tolerate PO and G-tube intake. 

ACUTE ISSUE:
#Nausea and vomiting:
#Inability to tolerate feeding:
#Moderate protein calorie malnutrition on tube feeds:
KUB showed the G-tube was located in the stomach. GI was 
consulted; EGD and gastrograffin study were normal. Her symptoms 
were thought to be related to her inability to tolerate tube 
feeds boluses. She as able to tolerate continuous tube feeds at 
a slow rate with incremental increase up to 60 cc/hour. The 
ultimate plan is for overnight continuous tube feeds at a rate 
of 80cc/hour for 12 hours (total 960 cc/day), supplemented by 
protein frappes/shakes during the day as tolerated. Patient was 
instructed to slowly increase the rate of the tube feeds at home 
to reach the 80 cc/hour goal, and try to supplement during the 
day with a few hours of tube feeds to ensure she gets the total 
960 cc/day.

#Upper GI bleed: Coffee ground discharge was noted from the G 
tube. The EGD showed no acute abnormality, so this was likely 
post-biopsy bleeding that has not recurred. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:
=====================
#Hypertension: Continued Metoprolol.
 
#GERD: Continued PO ranitidine.

#Allergic rhinitis: Continued Flonase.

***TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:***
- Patient should follow-up with gastroenterology and nutrition 
as outpatient
- Make sure patient is tolerating tube feeds overnight and that 
she was able to reach the goal of 80cc/hour for 12 hours
- No tube feeds boluses
- Make sure she is gaining weight
- Patient wants to change her doctors in ___, please ensure 
communication with her new doctors in ___ to ensure 
appropriate follow-up when she leaves ___

XRT ___, oropharyngeal dysphagia secondary to pharyngeal
paresis now s/p G-tube, malnutrition, presenting with nausea x 3
days and failure to thrive.

Ms. ___ has a hx of lung cancer, diagnosed in ___. She
underwent chemo and partial R lobectomy in ___ but had
recurrence in ___, for which XRT was performed. She 
subsequently
developed oropharyngeal dysphagia with pharyngeal paresis,
unresponsive to therapy. She gradually lost weight. Finally, 
give
unlikelihood of improvement in swallowing, a PEG was placed
___ and TFs initiated. She was initially able to continue
with pureed foods, but over the last few months her dysphagia
worsened to the point where she now tolerates only soup twice a
day. She experiences frequent nausea without emesis, as well as
early post-prandial satiety and regurgitation/pooling of
secretions. She has continued to lose weight (125 lbs approx ___
year ago to 94.5 lbs today). She was admitted ___, during
which her PEG placement was confirmed. EGD showed a normal
esophagus and a few superficial ulcers of the duodenal bulb.
Biopsy of the pylorus was negative. Her TF regimen was adjusted,
with the goal of 12h overnight feeding with a goal rate of
80cc/hr (for total of 960 cc/day). Weight at discharge 95 lbs.

Ms. ___ subsequently saw Dr. ___ in clinic on ___, at
which time A1c, TSH, vit D, CRP/ESR, SPEP, tTG-IgA, and H.pylori
serology were all negative. Gastroparesis was considered, but
gastric emptying study was deferred given BMI of 16 and 
inability
to treat if positive at this weight. Plan was to obtain 
Cologuard
(colonoscopy deferred for now given BMI), abdominal U/S and
consider repeat CT A/P (not yet done). 

Ms. ___ continues to have nausea and regurgitation/reflux
without emesis, worse over the last 3 days and particularly at
night, as well as early satiety. As a result, she has been 
unable
to increase her TFs to goal (currently at 75cc/hr from 6p-6a).
Dr. ___ attempted ___ 2 days ago, but the
patient could not administer the medication through the PEG and
reverted to ranitidine. She has previously trialed Nexium, which
resulted in severe heartburn. Zofran has provided no relief. Dr.
___ suggested she present for failure to thrive.

oropharyngeal dysphagia secondary to pharyngeal paresis now s/p 
G-tube, malnutrition, presenting with nausea x 3 days and 
failure to thrive.

ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS:
#Nausea:
#Inability to tolerate feeding:
#Moderate protein calorie malnutrition on tube feeds:
#Failure to thrive:
Patient presents with nausea and reflux, worse at night in the 
setting of increasing her TF rate. Unclear why she is not 
tolerating TFs well; ddx includes gastroparesis/delayed 
intestinal transit (although no diabetes or thyroid dysfunction) 
vs duodenal ulcers (seen on recent EGD). Her poor tolerance of
TFs may explain her persistent malnutrition and failure to 
thrive, but other considerations include malignancy (known lung 
CA reportedly in remission, recent mammography negative, overdue 
for colonoscopy but negative in ___ vs less likely autoimmune 
etiologies. Low suspicion for active infection. HIV, SPEP,
ESR/CRP negative. Less likely malabsorption in absence of 
diarrhea (celiac testing negative). TF position confirmed on 
recent admission, EGD largely unremarkable with exception of few 
shallow ulcers. 
- RUQ U/S, CT A/P with contrast without acute findings (just 
incidental adrenaloma, which will need outpatient workup).
- GI was consulted and recommended not forcing liquid 
supplements and PO intake as she can get adequate nutrition via 
PEG tube. Pt reports being tried on multiple PPIs and she either 
cannot tolerate them due to side effects, cannot fit them 
through the tube, or is not covered by insurance. Patient was 
continued on home H2 blocker per tube. Initially considered 
gastric emptying study but held off as both GI and Dr. ___ 
___ that even if she had gastroparesis, no good treatment 
options.
- stool guaiac x 3 given that she is overdue for colonoscopy
- ENT was consulted for evaluation of dysphagia, saw the patient 
and recommended keeping her outpatient appointment coming up on 
___. 
- Speech and swallow consulted who recommended outpatient clinic 
follow up for second opinion, as patient likely cannot tolerate 
oral contrast needed for modified barium swallow.
- would limit PO intake to sips as significant intake by mouth 
makes her nausea significantly worse

# Adrenal incidentaloma: patient requests us starting workup for 
incidental lesion seen on adrenal gland on CT as she lives far 
away and does not want to come back to ___ for workup. 
However, when I recommended adrenal protocol CT, she refused, 
saying that she had enough radiation for the time being, and 
wants to pursue that as an outpatient. However, she requested 
that we check labs. no symptoms/signs of hormone production, but 
sent out for renin, aldosterone, metanephrine for screening 
given hx of HTN-currently pending
- consider outpatient dexamethasone suppression test if felt to 
be necessary, but no clinical signs of ___

CHRONIC PROBLEMS:
# HTN: home Toprol continued

# Allergic rhinitis: continued home Flonase

# CAD:
# Hx TIA: continued home ASA 81mg daily

# HA: continued home fioricet

# HLD: continued home simvastatin

FOLLOW UP
- Need to complete adrenal incidentaloma workup as an outpatient
- Patient to follow up with outpatient ENT, speech and swallow 
for second opinion
-Patient needs to have plasma renin,aldosterone and metanephrine 
studies followed that are pending

___, oropharyngeal dysphagia ___ pharyngeal paresis s/p G-tube 
to GJ tube conversion 3 weeks prior, presents with nausea, 
increased stool frequency and failure to thrive. 

# Malnutrition
# Failure to thrive 
# Weight loss
# Nausea
She has had extensive workup as outpatient for the last 6 or so 
months including transition from G to J tube, changes in tube 
feeds, and still no improvement. In the hospital she noted 
feeling better with use of oxygen. GI was consulted and 
recommended consideration of neuroimaging to evaluate for 
central causes of nausea which was deferred as inpatient. 
Symptom management and supportive care was continued. It was 
felt that she would not benefit from any changes to her tube 
feed regimen, which had previously been attempted to address her 
symptoms. 

# Hypoxemia
Likely multifactorial ___ COPD and prior Lung Ca as well as 
aspiration. In the hospital she initially required supplemental 
oxygen but was subsequently >88% at rest. Nocturnally, she 
desaturated to the low 80% and was continued on 1L via NC. A CT 
scan was done which did not show PE or recurrence of her cancer 
or infiltrate. Her next CT is scheduled for ___ as an 
outpatient for screening. Pulmonary saw the patient and 
recommended initiation of duonebs q6hrs since she has been 
intolerant of other inhaled medications such as Breo or Anoro 
___ her dysphagia. Subsequently, she had ambulatory saturations 
done, which showed that she was 89% at rest on room air, 84-87% 
while ambulating on room air, and 96% ambulating on 2L 
supplemental oxygen. She continued to do well with 1L NC, which 
was started as outpatient, in particular with exertion and at 
night. She is set up already to see pulmonary as an outpatient 
later this month and can follow up to discuss other changes 
needed to her regimen.

# Diarrhea, resolved 
Attributed to contrast load, Imodium prn, stool studies 
negative.
 
# Hyponatremia, resolved
Attributed to hypovolemia the day of admission, responded to 
fluids, resolved.

# Hypertension: continued home metoprolol

# GERD: continued home ranitidine

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
[ ] CTA showed dilated pulmonary arteries; please consider 
obtaining a TTE as outpatient to evaluate for possible pulmonary 
hypertension, likely secondary to her lung disease.
[ ] Please continue current lung cancer screening.

CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST    
  
1. Minimal anterolisthesis of the C7 on T1 vertebral bodies and 
irregularity 
of the tips of the facets bilaterally at this level could be 
related to 
multilevel degenerative changes, but no prior exam is available 
for 
comparison. No definite fracture identified. Correlate with 
focal 
tenderness. MR can be obtained if there is concern for 
ligamentous injury. 
2. Possible atlantoaxial rotary subluxation. Correlate with 
patient ability 
to rotate his head. 
3. No prevertebral soft tissue abnormality. 
 

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Q111 CT HEAD 
 
  
1. Right parietal mildly hyperdense lesion with surrounding 
edema.  The 
differential diagnosis includes evolving hematoma, metastasis, 
lymphoma or 
glioblastoma.  The hyperdensity centrally argues somewhat 
against an abscess 
2. Right frontal scalp swelling without underlying fracture. 
  
CT HEAD W/ CONTRAST 

Thin rim of peripheral enhancement surrounding the small area of 
central 
hyperdensity within the right parietal lobe may represent a 
subacute/resolving 
intraparenchymal hematoma.  Please note that underlying mass is 
not excluded 
and continued followup will be necessary.  Abscess is also 
possible though 
considered less likely given lack of surrounding edema 

CT ABD/PELV
1. No evidence of malignancy in the abdomen or pelvis. 
2. Cholelithiasis, with no evidence of acute cholecystitis. 
3. Please refer to separate report of CT chest performed on the 
same day for 
description of the thoracic findings. 

CT CHEST
No chest CT findings to suggest metastatic disease.  No acute CT 
findings in the chest. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr ___ is an ___ yo M  with the PMH as above who fell after 
slipping on ice and having a head strike on car bumper with no 
loss of consciousness. Head CT showed a susp. of ___. As the 
patient could not have MRI d/t the presence of a pacemaker/ICD a 
further workup with CT brain w/ IV contrast was done which 
revealed a sub acute rim enhancing lesion.
Although the etiology of this lesion is currently unclear though 
given recent fall, likely due to this. It may represent a sub 
acute resolving hematoma, or underlying mass or metastasis. The 
patient had a CT chest, abdomen and pelvis which did not 
revealed any suspicious abnormality to account for brain 
metastasis. 
His lab work is currently reassuring with no obvious 
abnormalities as well.

The patient was consulted by general medicine that concluded 
that given this ring enhancing lesion, a likely etiology include 
lymphoma vrs metastasis vs abscess/infection (toxo) which is 
less likely.
 
Neurosurgery service was involved in his care and recommended 
putting the patient on keppra at least until be seen as an out 
patient by Dr ___ in two weeks.

In terms of his trauma: The patient was admitted to the ___ 
service after mechanical fall. His injuries included a minor 
facial laceration which was sutured in the ED, 7th rib Fx on the 
Lt which is well controlled with pain medication and minor 
bruising of his Lt knee.
TTS 24h after his injury was unremarkable with no new injuries 
uncovered.

The patient was evaluated by speech and swallow team after 
complaining of difficulty swallowing and was cleared. 
Physical therapist also evaluated the patient and suggested 
further recovery in a rehab facility. Rehab stay not anticipated 
to exceed 30 days. 

The patient is being discharged to rehab facility for further

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, it was a pleasure taking care of you in ___ you 
were admitted to the trauma surgery service after sustaining a 
fall Your injury caused Left 7th rib fracture a minor head 
contusion with small Right eye lid laceration. You were given 
pain medication and your breathing was closely watched. A brain 
lesion was noted on a CT scan of your head. The medical team 
evaluated the imagining and will contact your primary care 
provider, Dr. ___ to further discuss need for follow 
up. Please be sure to schedule a follow up appointment with this 
provider after being discharged from rehab.

You were evaluated by physical therapy and we recommend that you 
continue your recovery at rehab. 

You are now doing better and ready to be discharged to rehab. 

Please note the following discharge instructions. 

Your rib Fracture can cause severe pain and subsequently cause 
you to take shallow breaths because of the pain.
* You should take your pain medication as directed to stay ahead 
of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep breaths. If 
the pain medication is too sedating take half the dose and 
notify your physician.
* Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures.  In order to 
decrease your risk you must use your incentive spirometer 4 
times every hour while awake.  This will help expand the small 
airways in your lungs and assist in coughing up secretions that 
pool in the lungs.
* You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to hold 
against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing and 
deep breathing.
* Symptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short 
periods may ease the pain.
* Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you 
should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid 
and fiber intake if possible.
* Do NOT smoke
* If your doctor allows, non-steroidal ___ drugs 
are very effective in controlling pain ( ie, Ibuprofen, Motrin, 
Advil, Aleve, Naprosyn) but they have their own set of side 
effects so make sure your doctor approves.
* Return to the Emergency Room right away for any acute 
shortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation 
around your ribs (crepitus).
for your head trauma - you had a CT scan of your head that 
showed a mildly hyperdense lesion with surrounding edema in Rt 
parietal lobe without overlying Fx. this lesion was further 
evaluated with CT head with IV contrast that better defined this 
finding as sub acute/resolving  intraparenchymal hematoma but an 
underlying mass was not excluded and a follow-up will be 
necessary 
your eye lid laceration was sutured in the ED and the stiches 
will need to come out in a week.

IMAGING/STUDIES
===============
___ CT Head
IMPRESSION: 1. Interval evolution in appearance of a small left 
thalamic hemorrhage.  No new hemorrhage or territorial infarct. 
2. Partial visualization of right facial fractures with re- 
demonstration of right superior and lateral orbital wall 
fractures. 

___ CXR
FINDINGS:  Heart size is top-normal with re- demonstration of 
unfolding of the thoracic aorta.  Hilar contours are 
unremarkable.  Lungs are grossly clear.  Pleural service are 
clear without effusion or pneumothorax.  Right clavicular and 
multiple rib fractures are unchanged. 
  
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Right 
clavicular and multiple rib fractures unchanged. 

___ EEG
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU EEG monitoring 
study because of focal slowing in the left temporal region 
consistent with underlying cerebral dysfunction. There is 
generalized background slowing in the theta range, consistent 
with a mild encephalopathy. There are no epileptiform discharges 
or electrographic seizures. 

___ TTE
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses 
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is 
mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with 
hypokinesis of the distal LV/apex. No masses or thrombi are seen 
in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. 
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 
The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels 
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened 
but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild to moderate (___) 
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The 
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no 
pericardial effusion

___ X-ray clavicle
IMPRESSION:  
Again seen is the overlapping displaced fracture of the right 
midclavicle.  No significant callus formation. Superior and 
anterior subluxation of the humeral head relative to the 
glenoid. Mildly displaced fracture of the inferior aspect of the 
scapula. 

___ Left Wrist X-Ray
Overlying cast material limits evaluation of fine detail.  Again 
seen is the intra-articular distal radius fracture, without 
significant change in 
alignment.  No new fractures.  Severe degenerative changes of 
the thumb 
carpometacarpal, MCP and IP joints are again seen.  Moderate to 
severe 
degenerative changes of the triscaphe joint.

___ 05:35AM BLOOD Calcium-8.7 Phos-3.0 Mg-1.___ year-old woman with history of HTN, HLD, PMR who was recently 
hospitalized with traumatic fall with multiple fractures and 
SAH/IPH who now presents with confusion, intermittent slurred 
speech, and memory deficits found to have hyponatremia.

# SIADH with hyponatremia: ___ presented with dry mucous 
membranes and Na 125 on  suggestive of hypovolemic hyponatremia 
and initially improved with IVF. However, her sodium began to 
drop and urine electrolytes were consistent with SIADH. She was 
transferred to MICU ___ due to confusion and Na level of 117. 
She received hypertonic saline and her sodium began to 
normalize. Her home HCTZ and citalopram were held. She returned 
to the floor where fluid restriction and salt tabs allowed her 
sodium to recover. At discharge, Na was within normal range, 
___ was alert and oriented with baseline mental status.

# Toxic metabolic encephalopthy: Secondary to SIADH/hyponatremia 
as above. Head CT with evidence of new small thalamic hemorrhage 
which increases risk for seizure. Neurology consulted and 
recommended EEG which showed focal slowing in the left temporal 
region consistent with underlying cerebral dysfunction, 
generalized background slowing in the theta range, consistent 
with mild encephalopathy. No epileptiform discharges or 
electrographic seizures. She will follow up with neurology as an 
outpatient.
 
# Orthostatic hypotension: ___ continued to have dizziness 
and hypotension upon standing up. ___ had no history of 
orthostasis or dysautonomia. Likely this was secondary to 
deconditioning. Initial treatment with with boluses of IV NS 
(serum sodium remained stable) did not improve her condition. 
She was encouraged to spend her days upright in chair. She was 
started on midodrine TID (___) and Florinef 0.2mg with some 
improvement in supine to sitting symptoms. Cortisol levels were 
not abnormal in this ___ with chronic steroid use. Neurology 
was consulted for autonomic dysfunction and she will follow up 
with them. She continued to have intermittent hypotension on 
standing despite medications, compression stockings, and 
physical therapy. 

# Atrial flutter/fibrillation: asymptomatic from a cardiac 
standpoint but noted flutter waves on telemetry. She 
intermittently went into atrial fibrillation during the early 
part of her hospitalization. She subsequently was rate 
controlled with metoprolol. Given ICH, anticoagulation was 
deferred despite CHADS-2 3 (HTN, age, DM). TTE showed apical 
hypokinesis, EF~45%, w/ mild AR and MR. ___ AC with 
___ and family and decided to hold off given high risk for 
ICH. ___ was discharged on Metoprolol XL with good rate 
control.

# NSTEMI: no chest pain or angina equivalents. Troponin 0.04 on 
admission with deep TW on admission EKG. Repeat EKG in AM with 
TWI in I, aVL and V2-V6. Continued to be asymptomatic. Trops 
downtrended to <0.01. TTE showed apical hypokinesis, EF~45%, w/ 
mild AR and MR. ___ with suspected stress induced 
(Takotsubo) myopathy. Plan for repeat TTE as outpatient in 2 
months and cardiology follow up. 

# E.coli Catheter-associated UTI: ___ developed E. Coli UTI 
from indwelling Foley catheter. Foley catheter was removed. She 
completed 5 day course of Bactrim with resolution of dysuria.

# S/P fall with multiple fractures: Orthopedics deemed fractures 
non-operative. Pain control with acetaminophen and low dose prn 
oxycodone. Follow up scheduled. 

CHRONIC MEDICAL ISSUES:  
=======================
#HLD: continued atorvastatin
#Depression: held Citalopram during admission for hyponatremia, 
restarted at discharge
#GERD: continued home omeprazole
#PMR: continued home prednisone 5 mg daily
#HTN: Stopped atenolol, HCTZ, and lisinopril. Currently on 
metoprolol XL 50mg daily
#DM2: held metformin and put on Humalog ss for additional meal 
time coverage for BS >200  
# Supplements: continued thiamine  
# Bone Health: Given chronic steroids and fall with fractures 
started on vitamin D with calcium supplementation, continued 
home bisphosphonates

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted for dizziness and confusion from your rehab 
center, ___, and found to have low sodium levels. The low 
levels were related to your recent fall. During the course of 
this hospitalization, you were transferred to the ICU for 
treatment of your low sodium levels. At the time of discharge, 
your sodium levels were back to normal range. You also had low 
blood pressures and dizziness when standing up, likely from not 
being upright for a period of time. You were treated with IV 
fluids, compression stockings, and medications to raise your 
blood pressure. You were cleared by physical therapy to return 
to rehab. You also developed a urinary tract infection from your 
foley catheter, which we treated with antibiotics. Lastly, you 
developed some abnormal heart beats (Atrial 
flutter/fibrillation), so we gave you metoprolol, a medication 
to control your heart rate. You should get a repeat 
echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) in two months.

Please continue to take all medications as prescribed. If you 
experience lightheadedness, confusion, dizziness, headaches, 
visual changes, fevers, chills or worsening pain, please seek 
out medical attention.

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___ and we wish you the 
best of health moving forward.

Sincerely,

Your ___ team

transverse fracture is still visible extending into the 
articular surface but the margins of the fracture show calus 
formation.  A new lucent line, not extending into the articular 
surface, is visualized along the radial component of the distal 
bone, perpendicular to the old fracture.  This hyperlucent line, 
not visualized on the previous image, could represent an new 
fracture. A pre-existing fracture of the styloid is no longer 
clearly visualized.

fracture detected. 
  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o female with a past medical history of Aflutter, 
orthostatic hypotension currently on midodrine, h/o falls, DMII, 
PMR on prednisone who presented s/p fall and was found to have a 
right flank hematoma, transferred for medicine for management of 
fall, orthostatic hypotension and acute blood loss anemia.

#Fall, orthostatic hypotension: Patient has a history of 
orthostatic hypotension, numerous falls, and suffered a fall on 
___ at her living facility. She described losing her step 
upon getting out of bed, and had symptoms of lightheadedness at 
the time. She denied any loss of consciousness. For her 
orthostatic hypotension, patient at baseline is on midodrine. It 
is possible that ___ midodrine in combination with her 
beta blocker and lisinopril is contributing to her orthostatic 
hypotension. Patient is on chronic pred 5mg for PMR and there 
was initially a concern for possible adrenal insufficiency but 
this was ruled out (see below for more information). Patient 
also has peripheral neuropathy, and poor ambulatory function at 
baseline, both of which causes her gait to be unsteady as well. 
Patient denied any prior history of sudden LOC to suggest 
cardiac etiology. She also denied any palpitations or chest 
symptoms. She was monitored on tele without any notable cardiac 
events. Patient has a history of AF but remained in SR while she 
was hospitalized. There was no physical exam findings to suggest 
aortic stenosis. Hence, overall there is a low suspicion for 
structural heart disease. She denied any prior seizure history 
and was not post-ictal after her fall. ___ BP was in 
120s-140s/60s-70s prior to discharge and she was not 
orthostatic. All together, we believe patient suffered a fall in 
the setting of being on midodrine, and antihypertensives 
(lisinopril, metoprolol), in combination with poor 
balance/peripheral neuropathy at baseline. Patient was continued 
on home midodrine on discharge, and after a discussion with her 
PCP, ___ lisinopril was discontinued and metoprolol 
decreased to 25mg XL daily. Patient will follow-up with PCP to 
determine whether she should have any other adjustments to her 
medication doses.

#R/o adrenal insufficiency: Patient is on chronic pred 5mg for 
PMR, and in the process of working up for her fall, an AM 
cortisol returned at 1.1. This was likely artifact. We obtained 
a repeat cortisol, which returned as 15 and is more consistent 
with prior cortisol levels in our system. This repeat cortisol 
level was also drawn at a more appropriate time of the day. 
Given that patient did not have any orthostasis, without sodium 
or glucose abnormalities, and absence of other adrenal 
insufficiency symptoms, this level is likely a laboratory error. 
Patient was able to ambulate without any dizziness or other 
symptoms. This questionable cortisol result was communicated 
with outpatient PCP via phone call, who agreed that it is likely 
a non-issue. We continued patient back on home prednisone for 
her PMR upon discharge. 

#Acute blood loss anemia: Patient developed acute blood loss 
anemia in the setting of her fall and developing a large R flank 
hematoma. Hgb on discharge was 7.6 (baseline ___. She did 
not have any active evidence of bleeding on discharge, and her 
CT did not show any active extravasation. Patient will follow-up 
with her PCP, and should have her CBC repeated as an outpatient.

#R flank/extrathoracic hematoma: Patient suffered a fall and 
developed a large R flank hematoma. A CT scan showed the 
flank/extrathoracic hematoma was 18 x 12 x 4.3cm without any 
evidence of active extravasation. This was progressively 
resolving and improved at the time discharge. 

#L radial fracture, R midshaft clavicle fracture: Patient with 
fractures from prior fall in ___ and is s/p by ortho. Per 
ortho, ___ fractures are healing well and is best managed 
non-operatively. Per ortho, patient can be WBAT for LUE and RUE. 
She will follow-up in outpatient orthopedics clinic. 

#PMR: ___ PMR was stable during this inpatient 
hospitalization. We continued ___ home prednisone on 
discharge. 

#DMII: Patient was treated with ISS while inpatient with sugar 
levels remaining largely at goal. She was resumed on her 
outpatient DM regimen upon discharge.

#GERD: We continued patient on home omeprazole.

===============================================================
Transitional Issues:
1. Please follow-up on ___ orthostatic hypotension. After 
discussing with her primary care physician, ___ 
discontinued her lisinopril, decreased her metoprolol to 25mg XL 
daily and continued her home midodrine.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital after you suffered a fall at 
home. We evaluated you in the hospital and found that you had a 
big bruise on your right side. We believe this was likely due to 
your blood pressure being too low when you stand up. We stopped 
your lisinopril to help keep your blood pressure up, and it was 
in a good range while you were here. We also decreased your 
metoprolol from 50mg to 25 mg. We also called your primary care 
physician, ___ to let him know about these changes, and 
___ agreed that it was a good plan. You were able to work with 
the physical therapists who recommended that you receive more 
physical therapy sessions at home. You should follow-up with 
your primary care physician and the orthopedic doctors in the 
outpatient setting. Please take all your medications as 
instructed. It was a pleasure to care for you during this 
hospitalization.

We wish you the best.

Sincerely,
Your ___ Care Team

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old female who sustained a fall down 5 steps with head 
strike and unclear LOC
for unknown amount of time.  She was unable to recall why she 
fell. She activated her Life alert.  She was brought to an OSH 
where she was GCS ___.  She underwent a CT of the head which 
revealed a SAH/IPH. Cat scan imaging of the maxillary/face 
demonstrated multiple facial fractures: non-displaced right 
inferior orbital and maxillary sinus fracture without evidence 
of entrapment or intraorbital hemorrhage. She was given 
clindamycin and keppra at ___ and transferred to ___ for 
further
evaluation. 

Upon arrival to the hospital, the patient was admitted to the 
Trauma Intensive care unit for monitoring.  She was alert and 
oriented x 3. She was having ectopy with multiple runs of NSVT 
which improved with electrolytes repletion. Troponins were sent 
to rule out a cardiac contusion.  She was given additional 
intravenous fluids for a decreased urine output. On review of 
the imaging the patient was reported to have right sided ___ rib 
fractures, a right displaced clavicle fracture, a right scapula 
fracture and a sternal fracture. Her pain was controlled with 
oral analgesia. The patient was encouraged to use the incentive 
spirometer.    
 
The patient was transferred to the surgical floor on ___.  
Because of her multiple injuries, the Orthopedic, Neurosurgery, 
and Plastic surgery service were consulted.  No surgical 
intervention was indicated. The patient was placed on sinus 
precautions for the facial fractures and a sling was applied to 
support the right clavicle and scapular fracture.  Because of 
her orbital and maxillary sinus fracture, the Ophthalmology 
service was consulted.  Outpatient follow-up was recommended. 

During the remainder of the ___ hospital course, her vital 
signs remained stable and she was afebrile.  She was started on 
a regular diet. Her foley catheter was removed on ___ and she 
was voiding without difficulty.  Her hematocrit was stable at 31 
with a normal white blood cell count. In preparation for 
discharge, the patient was evaluated by physical and 
occupational therapy.  Recommendations were made for discharge 
to a rehabilitation facility to help the patient regain her 
strength and mobility.   

The patient was discharged on ___ in stable condition.  
Appointments for follow-up were made with the multiple services 
who were consulted in her care. 

Her aspirin is on hold until ___  

*****An incindental finding of a thrombosed left paraclinoid ICA 
aneurysm was identified on head CT.****

Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, Mrs. ___ is a ___ female with recent 
diagnosis of CLL (___), brief hospitalization last week for 
community acquired pneumonia, and past medical history 
significant for hypertension, coronary artery disease, 
hyperlipidemia, prior MI/CABG ___, who presented on this 
hospitalization with diarrhea, abdominal cramps, chills and 
marked leukocytosis despite dual antibiotic therapy for recent 
pneumonia. 
.
# Leukocytosis: Mrs. ___ reported recurrent chills, diarrhea, 
and gastric pain at time of admission. She had a WBC count of 
15.6 on ___ when she was discharged from hospital for recent 
pneumonia. On this admission (___) she had initial 
leukocytosis to 35 despite being on antibiotics for over a week. 
Given her GI complaints, immunocompromised baseline,and recent 
hospitalization, Clostridium difficile colitis was very high on 
the differential diagnosis list. Blood and urine cultures were 
negative, and rapid respiratory viral screen was unremarkable. 
C.difficile toxin was sent and returned positive. Therefore she 
was placed on P.O. Flagyl with liquid Vancomycin added. 
Frequency of diarrhea seemed to decrease throughout her hospital 
course and her abdominal pain tapered as well. She was 
tolerating a regular PO diet by hospital day two. Lung exam 
continued to improve and she had a very mild, non-productive 
cough that was ""much better"" than it had been a week earlier 
according to the patient. Last CXR done on ___ prior to 
discharge from the hospital a week ago showed interval 
resolution of previously described opacity at the left lung base 
and no new infiltrates were noticed. Given that she had been on 
fairly broad coverage for pneumonia, team felt that a worsening 
respiratory infection was unlikely the etiology of her 
leukocytosis. Moreover, her clinical PNA symptoms were 
improving. She completed her Azithromycin and she was continued 
on the last 2 remaining days of her Cefpodoxime to complete her 
PNA treatment. Overlapping Flagyl and oral Vancomycin were also 
continued while she completed her Cefpodoxime. She was 
discharged with instructions to finish another 10-days of her 
Flagyl and Vancomycin and she will follow-up as an outpatient 
with Dr. ___ in 2 weeks. 
.
# Diarrhea : As above, her diarrhea was eventually attributed to 
her C.difficile. She was placed on Flagyl and PO Vancomycin. 
Recent CT abdomen showed prominence of the biliary duct at its 
origin at the ampulla. This prompted concern over a possible  
choledochocele vs. small ampullary mass. Therefore, she was set 
up for outpatient follow-up abdominal ultrasound and endoscopy 
on ___ with ___. 
.
#Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia: Currently Stage 0 disease. She 
reports constitutional night sweats, chills, and a 55 lb weight 
loss over ___ year. No hepatosplenomegaly or overt lymphadenopathy 
noted on exam or on her recent CT scans of pelvis/abdomen. 
Oncology team continued to trend her CBC/differential daily. WBC 
count decreased slightly from 35-> 32 by time of discharge, 
which will hopefully continue to improve as she has another 10 
days of her Flagyl/Vancomycin therapy to complete. SPEP with 
quantitative immunoglobulins were ordered and were all within 
normal limits. She will plan to follow up with her primary 
oncologist as an outpatient at the end of ___. No 
additional medications required for her CLL at this juncture. 
.
#Para-ovarian Cyst: Recent CT picked up a cyst adjacent to her 
right ovary that could either be paraovarian or ovarian in 
nature. She also has some lower quadrant pains on exam, although 
likely due to C.difficile infection. PCP was emailed and office 
was called and notified of this finding and Dr. ___ 
___ that he would plan to follow-up on this issue with 
a repeat pelvic ultrasound. 
.
#Hypertension: Blood pressures were well-controlled and she 
remained predominantly  normotensive. She was continued on her 
usual home amlodipine and atenolol regimen.
.
#Coronary Artery Disease: Patient has notable cardiac history 
for MI with CABG back in ___. LFTs do not appear to be elevated 
on statin medication. No complaints of  chest pains, angina or 
dyspnea during her stay. She was continued on usual aspirin and 
simvastatin.
.
#Anxiety : Per last admission notes the patient has had some 
increased anxiety over the past few months since her diagnosis 
with CLL. Social work had counseled patient for coping advice 
and therapy. She was continued on her daily Celexa therapy. Mood 
appeared stable, appropriate affect. 
.
#Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition: Repleted electrolytes as 
needed. NPO for brief period after admission and then she was 
placed on a cardiac healthy diet. 
.
#Prophylaxis : Continued usual omeprazole for mild GERD history 
and GI protection. Continued secondary prevention with daily 
ASA.  Daily ambulation was encouraged for her DVT prophylaxis. 
.
#Code Status: Mrs. ___ was maintained as a full code for the 
entirety of her hospital course.  
.

Pt was recently hospitalized in ___ for C. diff infection 
and was treated with 2 weeks of PO vanc and PO flagyl. Pt found 
to have recurrent C. diff infection this admission w/ stool 
positive for C. diff toxin by EIA. Abdominal CT showed 
pancolitis, and WBC was elevated to 60's-70's this admission, up 
from prior baseline of 30. Pt was febrile on the day of 
admission. CXR was negative for pneumonia or other acute 
pathology. Pt defervesced and was afebrile for the rest of the 
hospital stay. Diarrhea was treated with PO vanco and IV flagyl. 
KUB ___ showed no significant change from admission CT, no 
megacolon, and no obstruction. Diarrhea gradually slowed w/ abx. 
Pt's IgG level on this admission was found to be 601, down from 
731 ___. Pt received a single dose of IVIg 400mg/kg prior to 
discharge. She was sent home with a vancomycin taper as 
recommended by the infectious diseases team.
.
2. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia:
Pt is currently not receiving treatment for CLL. WBC was 
elevated tp 60's-70's this admission due to C. diff infection in 
combination w/ known h/o CLL. Tests for HIV, HBC, HCV, and CMV 
were sent in case chemotherapy needed for treatment of CLL in

discussed the potential role of your home prescriptions for 
Dilaudid (Hydromorphone) and Neurontin (Gabapentin) as 
contributors to your confusion. It is advised that you adhere to 
your PCP's instruction for their continued use but to also 
monitor for potential medication side effects and interactions

HTN, dementia, HFpEF who presents to the ___ today with a chief 
complaint of lightheadedness and gait instability. Per the 
patient and her son, Ms. ___ was otherwise in her usual state 
of health until this morning, when she stood up from a chair and 
immediately felt very lightheaded, as if she were about to 
faint. She did not black out and was able to sit down on her 
chair, after which she felt slightly better, but not all that 
much. She called her son after these symptoms persisted, who was 
concerned and decided to bring her to the ___ for further 
evaluation. Of note, the patient sustained a fall on ___ when 
she slipped while walking outside with her son. She did not feel 
lightheaded prior to this fall. She apparently fell on her 
bottom without head strike. She was immediately able to stand 
back up without issues and was able to walk home, though she 
endorsed mild back pain today. Additionally, Ms. ___ underwent 
a ___ scan ___ for evaluation of a 40 pound weight loss 
which incidentally found a chronic right temporoparietal stroke. 
Her PCP obtained an MRI in ___ to evaluate both for the PET 
finding as well as memory difficulty which revealed multiple 
strokes. No further workup for etiology was done at this time. 
She also has a complex cystic lesion in the left adnexa which 
appears to be consistent with a cystic ovarian neoplasm. Denies 
fever/chills, n/v/d, dysuria, loss of vision, blurred vision, 
diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, vertigo, tinnitus or hearing 
difficulty. Denies difficulties producing or comprehending

Brief Hospital Course:
This is an ___ year old female with past medical history of CLL, 
dementia, CVA, CAD, admitted ___ with episode of 
presyncope secondary to orthostasis, also found to have acute 
bacterial UTI, volume repleted and status post completion of 
antibiotic course, with resolution of symptoms, able to be 
discharged home with 24 hour care

# Presyncope secondary to Orthostatic Hypotension - Patient 
presented with episode of presyncope on standing.  On 
admission, workup was notable for orthostasis (123/50s -> 
81/50s upon standing, HR 66 -> 75), as well as UTI (as below).  
ECG at baseline.  CT head in ___ was NEG for any acute 
intracranial abnormalities, showed known R temporoparietal/R 
corona radiata infarcts.  Patient was seen by neurology who 
felt that no acute neurologic processes were ongoing, but 
recommended outpatient neurologic follow-up for history of 
prior strokes.  Patient was given IV fluids due to suspected 
dehydration.  UTI treated (as below).  Patient was monitored on 
telemetry without tachyarrhythmias, although notable for 
borderline sinus bradycardia (although able to augment heart 
rate with exertion), prompting decrease of Metoprolol from 25mg 
daily to 12.5mg daily.  Patient subsequently seen by ___ and 
able to ambulate without symptoms.  Of note, subsequently 
patient still noted to have mild orthostasis by vitals signs 
and without symptoms--this was felt to relate to mild 
dysautonomia related to her age and dementia.  Discussed 
behavioral interventions with family and patient to help with 
minimizing symptoms.  
   
# Acute bacterial UTI - In setting of above symptoms, patient 
was found to have a positive UA and urine culture with Ecoli.  
Patient was initially treated with CTX 1g IV q24h, then 
transitioned to cefpodoxime 200mg po BID following culture 
return with pan-sensitive Ecoli.  

# Vascular dementia secondary to history of stroke - Patient 
with history of identification of prior strokes as part of 
outpatient dementia workup.  As above, patient was seen by 
neurology during this admission, who recommended 3 month 
neuro/stroke follow-up and consideration of outpatient MRA head 
and neck without contrast to evaluate for vessel stenosis, and 
TTE to evaluate for thrombus. Continued Rivastigmine and 
Citalopram while inpatient.  OT assessed patient, recommended 
increased supervision at home to ensure safety.  Patient's sons 
are aware, have agreed to discharge home with ___ discuss 
hiring in home ___ moving forward. 

# Thrombocytopenia - Platelets noted to be 135k during this 
admission; suspected to be secondary to acute illness (as 
above).  Would consider recheck as outpatient 

# Ovarian Mass - Patient with known ovarian mass, previously 
followed by ___ gyn-onc.  She had missed recent outpatient 
follow-up.  Team arranged for GYN-onc follow-up with Dr. ___.
  
----------------  
CHRONIC ISSUES:  
---------------- 
# Chronic lymphocytic leukemia - WBC 7.9.  Status post 
fludarabine, Cytoxan and Rituxan therapy in ___, completing a 
total of four cycles.  Follows with Dr. ___  

# Chronic Diastolic CHF - - Fractionated Metoprolol while 
inpatient, decreased succinate to 12.5mg qd on day of discharge. 
 

# Coronary artery disease s/p CABG in ___ - Continued ASA, 
atorva, metop  

# HLD - Continued Atorvastatin 80 mg PO QPM  

# HTN - On fosinopril at home, was on Lisinopril while 
inpatient, resumed home fosinopril at discharge

# GERD - Continued Omeprazole 40 mg PO BID   

# Vit D Def - Continued Vitamin D ___ UNIT PO DAILY 
  

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
- Patient found to have asymptomatic orthostasis during this 
admission;  would continue to educate caregivers regarding 
behavioral management--rising slowly from lying to standing
- Patient noted to be thrombocytopenic to ~135, most likely in 
setting of acute infection, should continue to monitored as 
outpatient, esp given hx of CLL 
- OT assessed patient, recommended increased supervision at 
home to maintain safety, patient discharged with ___ 
- Patient discharged on cefpodoxime to complete a 3-day course 
of antibiotics
- There needs to be further code status discussion between 
patient, sons, and PCP.  Patient's son stated that his mother 
previously stated wish to have 'no major life saving 
interventions,' though he needed to discuss the matter further 
with his brother.
- Scheduled for outpatient neuro/stroke follow-up with above 
recommended outpatient workup

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital because you were feeling dizzy 
and lightheaded at home.  The most likely cause of your symptoms 
is an abrupt change in blood pressure when you go from lying to 
standing (orthostatic hypotension).  In order to ___ minimize 
your symptoms, it is important that you maintain good fluid 
intake, sit on the edge of bed for several minutes prior to 
standing up in the morning, and wear compression stockings.  The 
dose for your beta blocker (Metoprolol) was also decreased to 
12.5mg daily as a slower heart rate may worsen your symptoms.   

Your heart was monitored throughout your admission and there 
were no episodes of abnormal heart rates/rhythms.  The 
neurologists examined you and felt that your symptoms were not 
consistent with a stroke.  It is important, however, that you 
follow-up with your new neurologist as scheduled below given 
your history of prior stroke.  

You were found to have a urinary tract infection, which you have 
also had in the past.  You were treated with intravenous 
antibiotics. Please take 1 additional dose of cefpodoxime to 
complete your course. 

It was a pleasure taking care of you!

Sincerely,

Your ___ Care Team

posterobasal akinesis. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic
valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic
valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT: Ms. ___ is a ___ with hx of recent urosepsis, 
NSTEMI and stroke one week prior to admission presenting with 
fall complicated by forehead hematoma and left 7th rib fracture. 
She was evaluated by surgery with no plan for urgent surgery. 
She was subsequently admitted to medicine for workup of fall and 
found to have a UTI and subtheraputic INR. She was bridged to a 
therapeutic INR prior to discharge and discharged on warfarin 
2.5mg daily. Her hematoma was observed and was stable. 

ACUTE ISSUES:
# Sub-galeal hematoma 
# Left 7th rib fracture
# Unwitnessed fall: 
The patient presented with a fall. she was observed on telemetry 
for 24 hours without evidence of arrhythmia. Orthostatic vital 
signs were checked on admission and were negative. She was found 
to have a UTI which likely worsened patients confusion and 
leading to fall. The patient has dementia at baseline and often 
gets confused and tries to get out of her chair/bed. The 
patients rib fracture does not need surgery follow-up. The 
patients was found to have a subglial hematoma on her left 
forehead. She had a head CT which showed no intracranial bleed. 
Surgery was consulted and did not recommended observation. The 
patients hematoma was stable during hospitalization and will 
likely resolve in the coming weeks. Her neurological exam was 
unchanged from baseline. She was discharged with cefpodoxime to 
complete a 5 day course for UTI.

#UTI
The patient was found to have UTI for CITROBACTER KOSERI. The 
patient did not have dysuria but did have increased urinary 
frequency. Of note, the patient has dementia and frequently asks 
to use the restroom as part of a tic from her dementia. She was 
initially treated with ceftriaxone on ___ and was 
transitioned to cefpodomixe to complete ___trial Fibrillation
The patient has a known history of atrial fibrillation with a 
Chadsvasc of 7. She was found to have subtheraputic INR. She was 
bridged to a therapeutic INR on heparin and was discharged on a 
warfarin dose of 2.5mg with an INR goal of ___. She was 
continued on home metoprolol with good rate control. 

# Left leg spasticity
- The patient had had leg spasticity since her stroke recently. 
She was previously treated with clonazepam at night. However 
with her recent fall this was held to limit deliriogenic 
medications. Neurology suggested trial of baclofen at night to 
reduce leg spasms. This was used with good effect. The patient 
will follow up with neurology as an outpatient for further 
management 

CHRONIC ISSUES
==============
# Embolic strokes (greatest in R ACA): 
Patient with stable neurology exam from last admission. She was 
continued on home anticoagulation with follow up as an 
outpatient 

# Severe MR
# Chronic Diastolic CHF: TTE last admission showing new RWMAs, 
worsened LVEF to 45%, severe MR 4+. This admission with 
bilateral pleural effusions but clinically dry on exam, not on 
diuretics at home. Bed weight 145 from 149lb on last discharge. 
She was diuresed with 20mg IV furosemide once and did not have 
reaccumulation of swelling. 

# CAD s/p CABG
# Chronic LBBB
The patient was continued on home Atorvastatin, ASA, Plavix and 
Metoprolol. Warfarin was bridged as above and continued at 2.5mg 
daily as an outpatient with an INR goal of ___ for atrial 
fibrillation. 

# Anemia
# Thrombocytopenia
# Hx of CLL: Had been stable as an outpt. Patient did not 
require transfusion.

# Dementia/psych
# Metabolic encephalopathy: 
Held home rivastigmine 3 BID (given nonformulary), continued 
home citalopram 40mg QD

# GERD: 
Continued home pantoprazole 

# Insomnia: 
Continued ramelteon prn for sleep

# Goals of Care: During previous admission, palliative care met 
with patient's son to discuss options in long term planning, 
felt they may benefit from palliative care involvement in the 
future pending patient's clinical course. Her Code status was 
changed to DNR/DNI on ___.

FINDINGS: 

MRI BRAIN:
Re-identified is a 29 x 19 mm acute right occipital paramedian
intraparenchymal hemorrhage, overall unchanged in size compared to recent
prior CT examination given difference of technique.  Surrounding edema and
localized mass effect is unchanged.  There is no definite underlying enhancing
mass., However, a prominent vessel is seen immediately inferiorly and
laterally to the hemorrhage (12:10), with other smaller mildly prominent
probable venous structure is seen surrounding the hemorrhage.

Another, subacute right posterior temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage is seen
measuring roughly 20 x 18 mm in size, corresponding to the hypodensity as seen
on the recent prior CT examination, and there is unchanged mild associated
mass effect.  No definite underlying enhancing lesion is seen.

There is additionally a small right temporal subdural hematoma measuring up to
6 mm in maximal thickness (9:7), demonstrating T1 and T2 hyperintensity, not
well seen on the prior CT examination, consistent with subacute hematoma.

Several other scattered areas of subcortical punctate low signal on gradient
echo images.  The significance of these is difficult to determine given the
severity of motion artifact on these images.  These may represent artifact or
vessels on end.  If they are true micro bleeds, this would suggest  cerebral
amyloid angiopathy, which would then be the most likely etiology for the areas
of intraparenchymal hemorrhage.

There is no evidence of new hemorrhage, mass, midline shift or infarction. 
There is mild prominence of the ventricles and sulci suggestive of
involutional change.  Confluent areas of periventricular, subcortical and deep
white matter T2/FLAIR hyperintensities are in a configuration most suggestive
of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.  There is no other abnormal
enhancement after contrast administration.  There is no focus of slow
diffusion to suggest acute infarct.  The principal intracranial vascular flow
voids are preserved.

There is mild mucosal wall thickening in the bilateral maxillary, sphenoid and
ethmoid sinuses.  The frontal sinuses are clear.  There are changes from right
lens replacement surgery.  The orbits are otherwise grossly unremarkable. 
There is nonspecific fluid opacification of the bilateral mastoid air cells.

MRA brain: There are mild irregularities of the bilateral P1 and P 2 segments
of the posterior cerebral arteries producing mild stenosis, greater on the
right, likely atherosclerotic.  There is a 7 x 3 mm posteriorly directed
outpouching of the petrous segment of the left internal carotid artery (4:96).
There is additionally mild irregularity and narrowing of the distal M1 segment
of the right middle cerebral artery, likely atherosclerotic.  The intracranial
vertebral and internal carotid arteries and their major branches otherwise
appear patent without evidence of high-grade stenosis, or occlusion.

IMPRESSION:


1. Grossly unchanged 29 x 19 mm acute right occipital intraparenchymal
hemorrhage without definite underlying enhancing mass.  However, a prominent
adjacent vessel is seen which could potentially represent draining veins in
the setting of arteriovenous malformation, or possibly a developmental venous
anomaly which could suggest an underlying cavernous malformation, though no
definite nidus is seen, potentially effaced by the volume of hemorrhage. 
Alternatively, given the scattered areas of subcortical chronic
microhemorrhage, cerebral amyloid is considered a reasonable explanation for
the cause of bleed.  In this case, the surrounding prominent vascularity may
be due to reactive hyperemia.
2. Additional 20 x 18 mm right posterior temporal subacute intraparenchymal
hemorrhage without definite underlying enhancing lesion or vascular
malformation seen.
3. Small right temporal subacute subdural hematoma measuring up to 6 mm in
maximal thickness, not well seen on the prior CT examination.
4. Mild narrowing of the P1 and P 2 segments of the bilateral posterior
cerebral arteries and distal M1 segment of the right middle cerebral artery,
likely atherosclerotic.
5. 7 x 3 mm posteriorly directed extradural aneurysm of the petrous segment of
the left internal carotid artery.
6. Otherwise patent intracranial arterial vasculature without high-grade
stenosis or occlusion.
7. Mild global atrophy and confluent areas of white matter signal abnormality
in a configuration most suggestive of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
8. Mild paranasal sinus mucosal wall thickening and bilateral mastoid air cell
opacification, nonspecific, which can be seen in the setting of acute
sinusitis given the appropriate clinical context.

RECOMMENDATION(S):  Continued follow-up examinations with gadolinium enhanced
MRI to resolution of hemorrhage is recommended in order to definitively
exclude an underlying mass or vascular malformation.

PROCEDURE DETAILS:

Following explanation of the risks, benefits and alternatives to the
procedure, written informed consent was obtained from the patient. The patient
was then brought to the computed tomography suite and placed left lateral
decubitus on the imaging table.  General anesthesia was induced by the
anesthesiologist.  Following
scout imaging, the skin was marked and draped in the usual sterile fashion.

Under CT fluoroscopy, a 16 gauge micro wave ablation probe was advanced into
the intercostal space
 until the tip of the probe was just beyond the expected location of the lung
lesion.  Along with the tract of the microwave ablation probe, a 17 gauge
coaxial needle was introduced into the lesion.  3 x 11 mm 18 gauge samples
were obtained from this nodule prior to the macro of ablation.  Microwave
ablation was performed for a total of 5 minutes at 80 watts.

Unenhanced computed tomography was obtained.  The skin was then cleaned and a
dry sterile dressing was applied. The patient was awakened from general
anesthesia without incident and there were no immediate post-procedure
complications. The patient was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit
for further monitoring.

___ AT 0939 HOURS.

HISTORY:  Trauma from fall.

COMPARISON:  None.

FINDINGS:  There is a slight downward subluxation of the humeral head relative
to the glenoid.  There is a transverse fracture through the surgical neck of
the humerus with a vertical component extending through and separating the
greater tuberosity.  Given the downward subluxation of the humeral head, there
is increase in the acromiohumeral interval.  The acromioclavicular joint and
coracoclavicular intervals respectively are both within normal limits.  The
remainder of the humerus is intact.  The elbow is appropriately aligned and
although the lateral view is suboptimal, no large effusion is evident.

IMPRESSION:  Comminuted 3-part humeral head fracture with downward subluxation
of the humeral head presumably due to hemarthrosis.  No significant angulation
or distraction of the fracture fragments is evident.

TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar proton density, T2 and T1 weighted sequences performed
on 1.5 Tesla magnet.

COMPARISON:  Left shoulder radiographs ___.

FINDINGS: 

Assessment is limited by suboptimal scan plane prescription.

The supraspinatus, infraspinatus and subscapularis tendons appear attenuated
but intact. This likely relates to chronic articular sided partial thickness
tearing, without a well-circumscribed focal tear visualized on the current
exam. The teres minor tendon is intact.

There is partial fatty atrophy of the infraspinatus muscle. Minimal fatty
atrophy of supraspinatus and subscapularis.

There is full thickness cartilage loss involving the posterior aspect of the
glenoid, with subchondral marrow edema. Similarly, full thickness cartilage
loss along the posterior aspect of the humeral head is present, with cortical
irregularity and subchondral degenerative signal change. Remodeling of the
left proximal humerus compatible with previous fracture is also present. There
is a relatively focal area of marrow signal abnormality along the anterior
aspect of the humeral head (series 5, image 6, series 4, image 11), which may
represent a small area of avascular necrosis. This measures about 1.5 cm.

The long head biceps tendon is intact. Assessment for labral pathology is
limited on this exam, but some degenerative free edge fraying is demonstrated
diffusely, and there is abnormal configuration of the anterior superior labrum
which appears somewhat displaced posteriorly (series 3, image 10) into the
joint.

No acute fracture is demonstrated. Trace fluid is present in the subacromial
subdeltoid bursa.

Mild subchondral marrow signal change at the glenoid is present.

There is a small glenohumeral effusion.

IMPRESSION:


1. Posttraumatic appearance of the left proximal humerus, with degenerative
changes which are severe at the glenohumeral joint, with a small focal area of
marrow signal change at the anterior aspect of the humeral head, suggesting a
small area of avascular necrosis.
2. The rotator cuff tendons are diffusely attenuated, suggesting chronic
partial thickness articular sided tears, without evidence of full-thickness
tear or well-circumscribed tear on the current exam.
3. Limited assessment of labrum demonstrates abnormal configuration of the
anterior superior labrum which appears somewhat displaced posteriorly into the
joint.
4. There is a small glenohumeral effusion.

possible images were obtained in this patient status post recent shoulder
surgery. This study was interpreted with the aid of ICAD computer aided
detection system.

FINDINGS: 

Tissue density: C - The breast tissues are heterogeneously dense and nodular
which lowers the sensitivity of mammography. Bilateral vascular calcifications
and scattered punctate calcifications are again seen in both breasts. Stable
asymmetry in the outer central right breast is suggestive of a benign finding.

TECHNIQUE:  BILATERAL FOREARMS: AP AND LATERAL VIEWS

COMPARISON:  None.

FINDINGS: 

Right forearm:  No acute fracture or dislocation is seen. Chronic appearing
deformity of the distal radius suggests a prior fracture.  There is also small
well corticated ossific structure adjacent to the ulnar styloid, again
suggesting prior trauma.  Extensive vascular calcifications are seen.
Osteoarthritic changes of the wrist better assessed on wrist radiographs.

Left forearm: A bandage/splint overlies the proximal hand, wrist and distal
forearm, partially obscuring the view. Given this, there may be subtle
cortical irregularity of the distal ulna, worrisome for a nondisplaced
fracture. No definite acute fracture is seen elsewhere. There is a 3 mm
radiopaque structure projecting over the mid shaft of the radius which could
represent a foreign body. Osteoarthritic changes at the triscaphe joint in the
first carpometacarpal joint are better assessed on the dedicated wrist
radiographs.

TECHNIQUE:  Bilateral wrists, three views of each

FINDINGS: 

Right wrist: There is no true AP view of the right wrist presented. There is
widening of the scapholunate interval and proximal migration of the capitate
bone, most consistent with scapholunate dissociation. Triscaphe joint
osteoarthritic changes are seen. Soft tissue swelling is noted about the
dorsal aspect of the hand, particular at the level of the distal metacarpals

Left wrist: Splint, bandage overlies the left wrist, partially obscuring the
view. Given this, the scapholunate interval is top-normal. No gross acute
fracture is identified, although a nondisplaced ulnar fracture suggested on
forearm radiographs is not excluded. There is severe osteoarthritic changes at
the first carpometacarpal joint and of the triscaphe joint. Chronic appearing
deformity of the distal radius and ulna suggest prior trauma.  Linear
radiopaque structure projects over the midshaft of the radius again could
represent a retained foreign body.

left hip

COMPARISON:  Right hip radiographs dated ___.  3 foot standing film
dated ___

FINDINGS: 

Compared with ___, the appearance is relatively similar.

Again seen is a left hip hemiarthroplasty, with cemented femoral stem.  As
before, there is lucency deep to the medial flange at the proximal edge of the
femur as well as some increased lucency surrounding the distal tip of the
femoral component and also bowing and endosteal scalloping along the medial
aspect of the distal femoral stem.  There is interruption of
methylmethacrylate adjacent to the distal tip of the femoral stem in 2
locations, but is not clear whether this was the original appearance or
represents a fracture through the cement.

Again seen is diffuse osteopenia, deformity of inferior pubic rami
bilaterally,  suggestive of old healed fractures. The sacrum is obscured by
overlying bowel gas, limiting assessment for sacral fracture or deformity.
Note is made of chondrocalcinosis of the pubic symphysis and right
femoroacetabular joint and extensive vascular calcification.

IMPRESSION: 

No definite change compared with ___ and ___. There is
equivocal interval change in the configuration of the cement along the inner
surface of the greater tuberosity, which could also be an artifact of
positioning.

Periprosthetic lucency, including an area of roughly 50% endosteal scalloping
anteriorly,  and fracture through the cement is concerning for prosthesis
loosening.  No bony fracture is identified.

most recent enhanced MR examination of ___, and a series of MR studies
dating to remote examination of ___ (digitized into PACS).  

As before, the patient is status post right paramedian frontal craniotomy,
with post-surgical changes, including small focal encephalomalacia and gliosis
involving the inferior portion of that frontal lobe, particularly that right
gyrus rectus, related to resection of the olfactory groove meningioma.  The
overall appearance is not significantly changed since the examination of

midline planum sphenoidale, which measures approximately 6 (AP) x 7 mm (9:8). 
This finding is not significantly changed since the most recent study of
___ and, likely, the preceding study of ___, and may represent
either post-operative granulation tissue or small residual meningioma, growing
very slowly.  There is no other pathologic extra- or intra-axial focus of
enhancement.  

Again demonstrated is a ""partially empty"" appearance to the sella turcica,
unchanged over the series, a common variant, with a normal appearance to the
optic chiasm, optic nerves, and optic tracts.  There is lobulated prominence
to the lateral margins of the cavernous sinuses, bilaterally; however, this is
unchanged over the series of studies and, based on a comparison of the
enhanced images and the non-enhanced T2-weighted images, this appears merely
to reflect excessive tortuosity of the carotid siphons, bilaterally.

The remainder of the examination is notable for moderate, proportionate
prominence of the extra-axial CSF spaces, the cortical sulci and fissures and
the ventricles and cisterns, representing global atrophy.  There is asymmetric
prominence of all components of the left lateral ventricle, as before, likely
congenital or developmental.  There is moderate T2-/FLAIR-hyperintensity in
periventricular, particularly periatrial, as well as central pontine white
matter, not significantly changed, likely the sequelae of chronic small vessel
ischemic disease.  There is no focus of slow diffusion to suggest an acute
ischemic event and the principal intracranial vascular flow-voids, including
those of the dural venous sinuses, are preserved and these structures enhance
normally.  Incidentally noted is a solitary mucus-retention cyst along the
left maxillary antral floor, also unchanged.

COMPARISON:  ___ head CT at 20:45.

FINDINGS: 

CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST:
There is a left superior frontal lobar hematoma, measuring 3.4 x 2.5 cm
compared to 3.0 x 2.4 cm on the prior CT of approximately 3.5 hr earlier.  The
apparent increase in the size of hematoma could be related to differences in
patient head position/scan angle.  There is mild surrounding edema and minimal
rightward deviation of the adjacent falx, unchanged.  There is no mass effect
on the ventricles.

There is a left posterior subgaleal hematoma.  There is no evidence for a
calvarial fracture.

There is fluid in the nasopharynx, oropharynx, and nasal cavity, which may be
secondary to endotracheal and orogastric intubation.  There is fluid in the
paranasal sinuses, as well as mucous retention cysts in the maxillary sinuses
and the left sphenoid sinus, and mucosal thickening in multiple paranasal
sinuses, which may be secondary to a combination of endotracheal intubation
and inflammatory disease.  There is mild partial opacification of bilateral
mastoid air cells.  Middle ear cavities are clear.

CTA NECK:
There is a 3 vessel aortic arch.  Mild mixed plaque in the proximal right
internal carotid artery causes approximately 10% stenosis by NASCET criteria. 
There is noncalcified plaque moderately narrowing the distal left common
carotid artery.  There is mixed plaque in the proximal left internal carotid
artery without stenosis by NASCET criteria.  The dominant left vertebral
artery appears widely patent.  There is moderate narrowing of the right
vertebral artery origin and the V1 segment by mixed, predominantly
noncalcified plaque.

CTA HEAD:
There are minimal calcified plaque in bilateral carotid siphons without
flow-limiting stenosis.  There is mild irregularity of the V4 segment of the
right vertebral artery distal to ___, likely due to non calcified
plaque.  There is no evidence for flow-limiting stenosis, aneurysm, or
arteriovenous malformation.  The dural venous sinuses appear patent.

OTHER:
There is partially visualized dependent opacity in the superior segment of the
right lower lobe which may represent atelectasis but is not fully assessed. 
No lymphadenopathy by CT criteria.  The thyroid gland is unremarkable.  There
are multilevel degenerative changes of the cervical spine.

IMPRESSION:


1. 3.4 x 2.5 cm left superior frontal lobar hematoma appear slightly larger
than on the head CT from approximately 3.5 hr earlier, but this could be
secondary to differences in patient head position/angle of the scan.  Mild
surrounding edema and mild associated mass effect appear stable.
2. Left posterior subgaleal hematoma.  No evidence for a calvarial fracture.
3. No evidence of intracranial arteriovenous malformation or aneurysm.
4. Moderate narrowing of the distal left common carotid artery by noncalcified
plaque.  Mild atherosclerosis of the proximal left internal carotid artery
without stenosis by NASCET criteria.
5. Approximately 10% stenosis of the proximal right internal carotid artery by
NASCET criteria.
6. Predominantly non calcified plaque causing moderate stenosis of the origin
and V1 segment of the non dominant right vertebral artery.
7. Mucous retention cysts in the paranasal sinuses indicate inflammatory
changes.  Fluid in the paranasal sinuses could be secondary to active
inflammation or endotracheal intubation.

ANESTHESIA:  Conscious sedation with local anesthetic.

TECHNIQUE:  AP, lateral, and where indicated three-dimensional rotational
angiography was performed of the intracranial circulation of the bilateral
carotid and left vertebral systems.

COMPARISON:  None.

PROCEDURE:  The patient was identified and brought to the angiography suite. 
He was positioned supine on the fluoroscopy table.  The bilateral groins were
prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Conscious sedation was
administered.  The location of the right common femoral artery was established
using anatomic and radiographic landmarks.  10 cc of 1% lidocaine without
epinephrine were infiltrated into the skin and soft tissue overlying the
vessel.  A 5 ___ short sheath was inserted into the right common femoral
artery and using micro puncture technique.  A 4 ___ Berenstein 2 diagnostic
catheter was prepared and connected to continuous heparinized saline flush. 
This catheter was advanced into the aortic arch over an 038 glidewire and used
to select the left vertebral artery.  Intracranial AP and lateral views of the
left vertebral circulation were then obtained.  The catheter was withdrawn
into the aortic arch, and again used to select the right common carotid
artery.  AP and lateral views of the right common circulation were next
obtained.  Under roadmap guidance, the right internal carotid artery was then
selected and intracranial AP and lateral imaging was performed.  The catheter
was withdrawn back into the aorta and used to select the left common carotid
artery.  Under roadmap guidance, the left external carotid artery was then
selected.  AP and lateral views of the left external carotid circulation were
next performed.  The catheter was then withdrawn into the left common carotid
artery and a follow-up roadmap obtained.  AP and lateral intracranial and
cervical views of the left common carotid circulation were next obtained.  The
catheter was then removed from the patient and a right common femoral
angiogram was performed through the sheath.  The arteriotomy site was closed
using a 6 ___ Angio-Seal device.  The patient was examined and found to be
at his neurologic baseline without evidence of thromboembolic complications.

This procedure was performed by Dr. ___ and Dr. ___.  I,

compare the appearance of the heart and lungs.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged
and there is mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels consistent with elevated
pulmonary venous pressure.  Opacification at the left base is consistent with
pleural fluid atelectatic changes.
There is the suggestion of patchy areas of opacification in the mid and lower

TECHNIQUE:  Sagittal T1 weighted, and axial T1 weighted, T2 weighted, FLAIR,
gradient echo, and diffusion-weighted images of the brain were obtained.
Following intravenous gadolinium administration (4.5 cc Gadovist), axial T1
weighted images of the brain and sagittal MPRAGE images of the brain with
multiplanar reformations were obtained.

COMPARISON:  Noncontrast head CT performed at 22:19 on ___ at
___.

FINDINGS: 

Multiple sequences are limited by motion artifact.

There is a hemorrhagic lesion in the right postcentral gyrus with low signal
throughout gradient echo images.  Evaluation of signal characteristics on
precontrast T1 weighted and T2 weighted images is limited by motion artifact,
but only minimal, if any, T1 hyperintensity seen.  The postcontrast axial T1
weighted spin echo images are distorted by motion artifact at the level of
late lesion.  The lesion demonstrates hyperintensity on the postcontrast MP
RAGE images, suggesting contrast enhancement.  It measures 1.4 x 1.2 x 0.9 cm
on the postcontrast MP RAGE images, 900:91 and 9:175.  There is associated
vasogenic edema extending from the subcortical white matter to the atrium of
the right lateral ventricle.  There is mild sulcal effacement, but no
effacement of the right lateral ventricle, and no shift of midline structures.

Gradient echo images demonstrate no evidence of blood products elsewhere in
the brain parenchyma.  Motion limited postcontrast MP RAGE and T1 weighted
images demonstrate no additional enhancing lesions.

T2 weighted and FLAIR images demonstrate extensive T2 hyperintensity in the
periventricular and deep white matter of the cerebral hemispheres, as well as
scattered T2 hyperintense subcortical white matter lesions, which are
nonspecific but likely sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic disease in
this age group.

There is  diffuse T2 hyperintensity within the pons without mass effect, which
may also be secondary to chronic small vessel ischemic disease.  Postcontrast
MP RAGE images suggest a developmental venous anomaly involving the left pons
and midbrain, with possible associated faint flow voids on T2 weighted images
; this is not seen on the motion degraded postcontrast T1 weighted spin echo
images.

There is no acute diffusion abnormality.  Ventricles and sulci are normal in
size for age.  Cerebellar tonsils are normally positioned.  Major arterial
flow voids appear grossly preserved.  Major dural venous sinuses appear patent
on postcontrast MP RAGE images.

There is mild mucosal thickening in the ethmoid air cells.

IMPRESSION:


1. Significantly motion-limited exam.
2. The hemorrhagic lesion in the right postcentral gyrus appears to
demonstrate contrast enhancement, suggesting a metastasis.  While there is
associated vasogenic edema, there is no mass effect on the right lateral
ventricle and no shift of midline structures.
3. No evidence for additional hemorrhagic lesions.  No additional enhancing
mass lesions are detected on significantly motion-limited evaluation.

of which appear slightly larger and more prominent as compared to the prior
examination.  Additionally, there is a small amount of intraventricular
hemorrhage seen layering within the occipital horns of the left and right
lateral ventricles.  Mildly prominent bilateral extra-axial spaces may
represent chronic subdural hematomas.  There is no appreciable focal mass
effect, midline shift, or evidence of downward herniation.

A large white matter hypodensity adjacent to the posterior left lateral
ventricle likely reflects a chronic infarct, though appears new from the prior

FINDINGS: 

There are bilateral subdural collections, which have decreased in the interval
to 3 mm on the right (previously 11 mm) and 3 mm on the left (previously 10
mm) in maximum thickness on the axial images.  On the coronal images, the
right subdural collection has increased to 16 mm (previously 11 mm) in maximum
thickness and the left subdural collection has decreased to 10 mm (previously
12 mm), although the extent of both subdural collections along the cranial
convexity is a greatly reduced from prior exam, consistent with overall
decrease in size.  Associated midline shift has decreased to 2 mm (previously
4 mm).  However, the bilateral subdural collections now demonstrate mixed
density, including areas of relatively high density, suggestive of acute or
subacute hemorrhage into the previously seen fluid density subdural
collections.

There is no evidence of new intraparenchymal infarction, hemorrhage, edema, or
mass.  The ventricles and sulci are larger than on prior exam, likely
reflecting decreased size of the bilateral subdural collections. 
Periventricular and deep white matter hypodensities are consistent with small
vessel ischemic disease.  Chronic infarction again noted in the left basal
ganglia and the adjacent white matter.  Neck infarction also noted again in
the left parietal lobe.

FINDINGS: 

A 3.9 x 2.7 x 3.9-cm intraparenchymal, mixed density, predominantly hyperdense
region within the right parietal lobe is consistent with an acute
intraparenchymal hemorrhage (series 2, image 21; series 601b, image 72).  The
hemorrhage has local mass effect on adjacent sulci and the right ventricle. 
There is hyperdense material within the occipital horns of the lateral
ventricles, moderate on the right and trace on the left, compatible with
intraventricular extension of hemorrhage (series 2, image 14). 
Moderate-to-severe, surrounding hypodensity within the white matter may
reflect edema.  Gray-white matter differentiation appears grossly preserved. 
Nonspecific, bilateral periventricular, subcortical, and deep white matter
hypodensities could be seen as sequelae of chronic small vessel disease or
prior insults, without prior exams with which to compare.  Basal ganglia
calcifications are normal for the patient's age.  Bilateral, symmetric
prominence of the ventricles (including third ventricle and temporal horns)
and sulci suggests severe cortical volume loss.  No shift of normally midline
structures.

No evidence of fracture.  A right frontal inner table calvarial osteoma is
small (series 601b, image 21).  Other than small, polypoid mucosal thickening

FINDINGS: 

CHEST:  Patient is intubated and the tip of the endotracheal tube is located
approximately 11 mm above the carina.  Slight retraction by at least 1 cm
would result in more optimal positioning.  The thoracic aorta appears intact. 
No mediastinal hematoma.  Small mediastinal lymph nodes do not meet size
criteria for pathologic enlargement.  The main pulmonary artery and central
branches appear patent.  The heart is within normal limits of size.  No
pleural or pericardial effusion is seen.  The esophagus appears minimally
fluid distended.

The lungs are clear without worrisome nodule, mass, or consolidation.  Mild
left basal atelectasis is noted.

ABDOMEN:  The stomach is markedly distended, consider NG tube decompression. 
The liver appears intact.  A small hypodensity at the hepatic dome is likely a
cyst.  No signs of liver laceration or contusion.  The main portal vein is
patent.  The gallbladder appears normal.  Common bile duct is normal in
caliber.  There is a rounded hypodensity within the uncinate process of the
pancreas measuring 1.6 x 1.6 cm, indeterminate.  A second smaller hypodensity
within the mid body of the pancreas measures 6 mm, series 2, image 126.  A
nonemergent MRCP may be performed to further assess.  The spleen appears
normal and appears intact.  The adrenals are normal bilaterally.  A left renal
upper pole hypodensity measures 12 mm and is likely a cyst.  Kidneys otherwise
unremarkable.  The abdominal aorta is moderately moderately calcified and non
aneurysmal.

PELVIS: Small bowel loops demonstrate no signs of ileus or obstruction.  The
colon contains a moderate fecal load.  No signs of bowel or mesenteric injury.
Urinary bladder is only partially distended.  The uterus appears grossly
unremarkable aside from the presence of a presumed calcified fibroid.  A large
left anterior pelvic hematoma is related to left pubic rami fractures detailed
below.  Asymmetric prominence of the right piriformis muscle likely due to a
component of intramuscular hematoma in the setting of right sacral fracture. 
No evidence of active bleeding.

BONES: Right sacral ale are fracture appears vertically oriented and extends
partially to the right SI joint.  There is associated mild widening of the
right SI joint suggesting potential ligamentous injury.  Additionally,
minimally displaced fractures of the right superior and inferior pubic ramus
noted without significant associated hematoma.  There is a complex fracture of
the left superior and inferior pubic ramus with multiple fracture fragments. 
Additionally, there is a large posteriorly displaced fracture fragment from
the left superior ramus fracture with significant surrounding hematoma
demonstrating no evidence of active extravasation.  No additional fracture is
seen.

COMPARISON:  ___ 22:14 noncontrast head CT from ___.

FINDINGS:


NONCONTRAST HEAD CT  There is a parenchymal hemorrhage involving the right
anterior caudate, lentiform nucleus, and surrounding white matter, stable in
size compared to the prior CT from approximately 7 hr earlier.  There is
stable mild surrounding edema. The hemorrhage extends into the frontal horn,
body, and occipital horn right lateral ventricle, and minimally into the
occipital horn of the left lateral ventricle, as before. Dilatation of the
lateral and third ventricles has slightly decreased compared to 7 hr earlier.
There is extensive confluent hypodensity in the subcortical, deep, and
periventricular white matter of the cerebral hemispheres, nonspecific but
likely sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic disease in a patient of this
age. There is faint gyriform hyperdensity in the left parietal lobe on image
3:18, which may reflect mineralization from prior hemorrhage. Basal cisterns
are not compressed.

The bones are demineralized. There is trace fluid in the left sphenoid sinus.
Other paranasal sinuses are essentially well aerated. Evaluation of mastoid
air cells is limited by volume averaging ; mild partial bilateral
opacification is not excluded.

HEAD CTA  There is mild calcification of bilateral carotid siphons without
associated stenosis. M1 segment of the right middle cerebral artery slightly
smaller than the left. However, bilateral middle cerebral artery branches
appear symmetric. Bilateral anterior cerebral arteries are unremarkable. 
Anterior communicating artery is hypoplastic.  There is fetal-type
configuration of the right posterior cerebral artery and fetal configuration
of the left posterior cerebral artery. Concordantly, the vertebrobasilar
system is relatively small in caliber. There is mild narrowing of the distal
basilar artery. There is a 2 mm basilar tip aneurysm at the expected origin of
the aplastic left P1 segment.

There is no evidence for an arteriovenous abnormality in the area of the right
basal ganglia hemorrhage.

IMPRESSION:


1. Proximal hemorrhage involving the right basal ganglia and surrounding white
matter, stable compared to 7 hr earlier, with stable intraventricular
extension.
2. Decreased dilatation of the lateral and third ventricles compared to 7 hr
earlier.
3. No evidence for an arteriovenous abnormality in the area of the right
parenchymal hemorrhage, which is most likely hypertensive.
4. Small caliber of the vertebrobasilar system secondary to fetal-type right
posterior cerebral artery and fetal left posterior cerebral artery. Mild
narrowing of the distal basilar artery. 2 mm basilar tip aneurysm at the
expected origin of the aplastic left P1 segment. This is highly unlikely to be

FINDINGS: 

Again seen is intraparenchymal hemorrhage involving the right basal ganglia
measuring approximately 2.8 x 2.8 cm (series 9, image 12) which is centered in
the caudate head and extends into the anterior limb of the internal capsule,
the globus pallidus the putamen. The hemorrhage extends into the ventricles
with a moderate amount of hemorrhage within the right lateral ventricle and a
small amount of hemorrhage within the occipital horn of the left lateral
ventricle. It is difficult to get reliable diffusion information in this
region due to hemorrhage. There is no abnormal enhancement to suggest
underlying mass. The ventricles and sulci are mildly enlarged but unchanged in
size and configuration since the prior study. There is no other areas of
intraparenchymal hemorrhage.

The intracranial flow voids are preserved. The globes are intact. The
visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.

CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST:
A hyperdense left temporal periventricular intraparenchymal hemorrhage with
intraventricular extension as demonstrated by a small amount of hyperdense
hemorrhage layering in the occipital horns of both lateral ventricles is
grossly unchanged compared to prior examination.  There is no evidence of new
hemorrhage or acute vascular territorial infarction.  Extensive
periventricular, subcortical, and deep white matter hypodensities are
nonspecific but likely sequelae of chronic microangiopathy in a patient of
this age.  Rounded hypodensity in the right caudate likely represents a
chronic lacunar infarct (03:14).

Edema surrounding the left temporal hematoma and mass effect on the temporal
horn of the left lateral ventricle are unchanged.  The ventricles are stable
in size and configuration.  There is no shift of normally midline structures. 
Mild global prominence of the ventricles and sulci is in keeping with
involutional changes.

There is an air-fluid level in the right sphenoid sinus and trace aerosolized
secretions in the left sphenoid sinus.  The visualized portion of the  mastoid
air cells, and middle ear cavities are clear. The visualized portion of the

There is a three vessel aortic arch with moderate mixed plaque resulting in
mild luminal narrowing of the origin of the branch vessels.  The origin of the
right common carotid and bilateral vertebral arteries are widely patent. 
There is mild predominantly calcified plaque in the right carotid bulb.  There
is no internal carotid artery stenosis by NASCET criteria.  The vertebral
arteries are within normal limits.  Nonocclusive atherosclerotic plaque
involving the left subclavian artery origin is noted (see 5:73).

It is possible the high density reflects hemorrhage.  The inhomogeneity is not
typical of an evolving hematoma alone, raising the possibility that this may
be associated with an underlying neoplasm.  This would be better evaluated
with magnetic resonance imaging.

Prominence of the ventricles and sulci likely represents age related
involutional changes. Periventricular and scattered subcortical white matter
hypodensities are nonspecific but likely sequelae of chronic small vessel
ischemic disease.

There is an approximately 14 x 20 mm evolving right thalamic hematoma, similar
to the allowing for differences in the appearance of blood on different

hyperintense blood products to indicate an underlying mass.  Surrounding edema
appear stable in extent.  Partial effacement of the third ventricle is
unchanged.  Prominence of the lateral ventricles is also stable, at least in
part related to parenchymal volume loss, as the sulci are also enlarged.

There is no evidence for blood products or masses elsewhere in the
intracranial compartment.

A small curvilinear focus of slow diffusion in the right globus pallidus with
associated T2/FLAIR hyperintense signal, without associated blood products,
consistent with a late acute infarct (series 502, image 17).  There is no
associated contrast enhancement.

Confluent periventricular white matter high T2 signal, as well as foci of high
T2 signal in the subcortical and deep white matter of the cerebral
hemispheres, and confluent high T2 signal in the pons, without associated slow
diffusion or contrast enhancement, are nonspecific but probably sequelae of
chronic small vessel ischemic disease in this age group.  Prominence of the
ventricles and sulci is in keeping with age related involutional changes. 
Principal intracranial vascular flow voids are preserved.  Major dural venous
sinuses appear patent on postcontrast MP RAGE images.

There is extensive fluid opacification of the right greater than left mastoid
air cells, and fluid versus aerosolized secretions in the left sphenoid sinus,
which may be secondary to prolonged supine positioning in the inpatient
setting.  There is minimal mucosal thickening in the ethmoid air cells.  There
is evidence of bilateral cataract surgery.

1. 14 x 20 mm evolving right thalamic hematoma with adjacent edema and mass
effect on the third ventricle is stable compared to the prior CT allowing for
differences in modalities.  No evidence for contrast enhancement outside of

also unchanged.  There is no evidence of new infarction.  Pneumocephalus is
decreased in comparison to the prior exam, with a smaller amount seen layering
along the right more than left frontal convexities anti dependently. 
Previously seen left subdral collection is smaller from prior exams.  The
right extra-axial mixed density fluid collection has decreased in size from
prior exam, now 6 mm versus previously 9 mm when measured in a similar fashion
(3, 70), with a small amount of crescentic hyperdensity seen subjacent to the
craniotomy site consistent with trace residual acute blood products (3, 13). 
Hyperdense right dural thickening underlying the parietal craniotomy site is
noted, unchanged.  Minimal hyperdensity along the falx is decreased in
conspicuity in comparison to the prior exam (for example see series 3, image
30).  Tiny focus of hyperdensity in the centrum semiovale (series 3, image 31)
is unchanged, likely small amount of acute blood products.  Hyperdensities
centered in the lateral right temporal lobe cortex are also unchanged, likely
a small amount of residual acute blood products (3, 14).  No new focus of

right parietal scalp soft tissues including skin staples, small amount of
subcutaneous emphysema, and mild swelling.  Right maxillary sinus mucosal
thickening with fluid and inspissated secretions is unchanged.  More mild left
maxillary sinus mucosal thickening is unchanged.  There is mucosal thickening

Compared with the most recent CT exam, the hyperdense intraparenchymal
hemorrhage in involving the left thalamus and medial temporal lobe appears to
have slightly increased in size, now measuring up to 3.6 x 3.5 x 3.4 cm
(series 2, image 17; series 601b, image 54), previously 3.3 x 3.3 x 3.1 cm. 
Intraventricular extension of hemorrhage into the lateral ventricle is grossly
stable allowing for differences in patient position.  There is also unchanged
blood within the third and fourth ventricles.  There may be a trace amount of
intraventricular hemorrhage layering in the occipital horn of the right
lateral ventricle consistent with redistribution.  The right lateral ventricle
and the temporal horn of left lateral ventricle have increased in size,
indicating entrapment.

Edema is again seen surrounding the above-described parenchymal hemorrhage. 
There is increased, now 12 mm rightward shift of normally midline structures,
previously 9 mm.  Left uncal herniation is again demonstrated, perhaps also
slightly progressed.  The left ambient cistern remains effaced.  No evidence
of tonsillar herniation.

Chronic left medial occipital lobe infarct is unchanged.  Bilateral,
nonspecific periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensities are
also overall unchanged and likely sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic
disease.  Background global parenchymal volume loss that is likely age-related
is also unchanged.

Bilateral cavernous internal carotid artery and V4 calcifications are noted.

No fracture seen.  Mucosal thickening of the frontal sinuses and ethmoidal air
cells is mild.  Remaining partially imaged paranasal sinuses are clear.  The
mastoid air cells and middle ear these are clear.  The orbits are

There are no prior chest radiographs available for review.

Right subclavian central venous line tip at the level of the carina is in the
mid SVC if it is intravascular, but because of severe mediastinal widening I

either adenopathy or fat deposition and than bleeding ; I am told that the
right central venous infusion port was not placed recently, and therefore
bleeding is unlikely.  Nevertheless there is a moderate right pleural
effusion.  The cardiac enlargement is severe, pulmonary vasculature is
engorged, the hilar are enlarged and there is mild pulmonary edema.

Study is moderately degraded by motion, especially on MR angiography.

MRI BRAIN:
Again seen is left thalamic and parietal lobe intraparenchymal hematoma,
demonstrating isointense T1, hypointense T2, with associated susceptibility
artifact and peripheral areas of slow diffusion, compatible with an acute
hematoma, measuring 4.5 x 3.3 cm, unchanged in size.  There is no associated
enhancing mass or abnormal enhancement.

There is surrounding FLAIR hyperintense signal and edema exerting mass effect
on the left lateral ventricle, with 5 mm rightward midline shift, similar to
the prior study.  The size of the lateral ventricles are unchanged with
prominent bilateral temporal horns again seen.  There is rightward deviation
of the third ventricle.  Left and right lateral ventricle intraventricular
hemorrhage is again noted.

There is hyperintense FLAIR signal extending inferiorly into the left aspect
of the midbrain and medial left temporal lobe.  There is effacement of the
left perimesencephalic and ambient cistern with uncal herniation.  The fourth
ventricle is unchanged in size, again demonstrating blood products.

Nonspecific nonenhancing left medial cerebellar encephalomalacia with adjacent
FLAIR hyperintensity is noted, suggestive of chronic infarct.

Small linear right external capsule encephalomalacia with associated increase
susceptibility is suggested (see 17, 18, 20:13), suggestive of chronic
hemorrhage.

The visualized major arterial vascular flow voids are preserved.  There is
partial bilateral anterior ethmoid air cell mucosal opacification.  The
remaining paranasal sinuses appear clear.  There is nonspecific nasopharyngeal
opacification, likely iatrogenic from enteric tube placement.  There is
nonspecific mild left mastoid air cell mucosal opacification.

MRA BRAIN:
There is no evidence of vascular malformation.  There is apparent left middle
cerebral artery reduced flow related enhancement, which is felt to be
artifactual given the presence of enhancement on postcontrast images. 
Otherwise, the visualized arterial vasculature, including the circle of ___
appear patent without stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm formation.  There is
decreased flow related enhancement within the posterior cerebral arteries
bilaterally, which is likely artifactual.  There is a right dominant vertebral
artery.

MRA NECK:
The common, internal and external carotid arteries appear normal.  There is no
evidence of internal carotid artery stenosis by NASCET criteria.  The origins
of the great vessels, subclavian and vertebral arteries appear normal
bilaterally.

IMPRESSION:


1.  Study is moderately degraded by motion.
2. Acute left thalamic and parietal lobe intraparenchymal hematoma, with no
definite enhancing mass identified.  Please note that underlying mass is not
excluded on the basis of this examination.  Recommend follow-up imaging to
resolution.
3. Grossly stable intraventricular hemorrhage, as described.
4. Surrounding edema extending into the left midbrain and medial left temporal
lobe, exerting mass effect on the left lateral ventricle with unchanged 5 mm
rightward midline shift, with effacement of the left perimesencephalic and
ambient cistern and left-sided uncal herniation.
5.  Within limits of study, no definite evidence of stenosis, occlusion,
aneurysm, or arteriovenous malformation.
6. Limited imaging of the chest suggest large right and small left pleural
effusions.  Recommend correlation with dedicated chest imaging.

RECOMMENDATION(S):  Acute left thalamic and parietal lobe intraparenchymal
hematoma, with no definite enhancing mass identified. Please note that
underlying mass is not excluded on the basis of this examination.  Recommend

FINDINGS: 

Please note that the study is moderately degraded by motion limiting the
evaluation.  Within with this confines:

There is of 1 cm focus of susceptibility in the right frontal lobe
corresponding to the previously seen hyperdensity with minimal peripheral rim
of T1 intrinsic hyperintensity.  On T2 sequences, there is surrounding
peripheral rim of hypo intensity with central hyperintensity (series 15, image
16) with questionable central enhancement (series 14, image 16; series 100b,
image 63).  There is a likely associated developmental venous anomaly (series
100b, image 57).  The findings would suggest a cavernous malformation, however
given spiculated nodules in the lung and possible enhancement short-term
interval follow-up to resolution is recommended to exclude more worrisome
lesion.

No acute intracranial infarct is seen.  No mass or midline shift is seen. 
There is no abnormal enhancement on postcontrast images.  The ventricles and
sulci are patent and prominent in keeping with age-related volume loss.

There are extensive areas of T2/FLAIR hyperintensity in the subcortical and
periventricular white matter, nonspecific, likely secondary to small vessel
ischemic disease.

The orbits are unremarkable.  There is mild mucosal thickening in bilateral
anterior ethmoid air cells and left maxillary sinus.  The remaining visualized
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.  There is a 6 mm aneurysm
at the right MCA bifurcation, better evaluated on recent prior CTA of the

HEAD MRI:  There is no acute infarction, edema, mass effect, or evidence of
blood products in the brain parenchyma.  There are multiple small foci of high
T2 signal in the subcortical, deep, and periventricular white matter of the
cerebral hemispheres, nonspecific but likely sequela of chronic small vessel

evidence of significant stenoses.  Bilateral M1 segments of middle cerebral
arteries are patent without evidence of stenoses.  The proximal inferior
division of the right middle cerebral artery appears smaller than the left. 
There are artifacts through this area on the source data bilaterally, yet this

artery, right posterior inferior cerebellar artery, bilateral anterior
inferior cerebellar arteries, bilateral superior cerebellar arteries, and
bilateral posterior cerebral arteries appear patent without evidence of
stenoses.  The left posterior cerebral artery receives a large contribution
from the left posterior communicating artery, but the left P1 segment is
patent.  There is no evidence for an intracranial aneurysm.

NECK MRA:  The origins of the common carotid and vertebral arteries are not
adequately assessed.  Otherwise, the common carotid arteries are patent
without evidence of stenoses.  There is signal loss at the origin of the right
internal carotid artery with an apparent 50% stenosis.  However, evaluation of
the proximal internal carotid arteries is prone to artifacts when using the 2D
time-of-flight technique.  The left internal carotid artery appears patent
without evidence of hemodynamically significant stenoses.  The cervical

COMPARISON:   LEFT SHOULDER CT SCAN FROM ___ ; LEFT SHOULDER
RADIOGRAPH FROM ___

FINDINGS: 

There is no anterior/posterior subluxation or dislocation of the humeral head
with respect to the glenoid, but there is inferior subluxation. As on the
prior study, there is a ___ deformity of the proximal humeral head as
well as a Bankart fracture of the anteroinferior glenoid. There is marked
narrowing of the glenohumeral joint. Small fracture fragments are noted in the
axillary recess of the glenohumeral joint. Additional tiny fragments are seen
at the far posterosuperiorly (03:26).

In the interim, the patient has undergone surgery, with placement of soft
tissue anchors in the humeral head. An anchor in the proximal humeral shaft
remains seated and likely corresponds to a biceps tenotomy.

Superimposed on all this, there is a new fracture of the proximal humerus
slightly impacted, but without other displacement. This appears to include a
surgical neck component with slight impaction and a greater tuberosity
component. There is arguably also a fracture line along the anatomic neck. As
on the radiograph, the fracture lines extends toward the metadiaphysis of the
proximal humerus laterally. No convincing lesser tuberosity component is
identified.

The soft tissue anchors within the humeral head are in the region of the
fracture, though not clearly displaced.

Assessment of the soft tissues is limited, but shows a large glenohumeral
joint effusion.
Note is made of moderate to moderately severe atrophy of the infraspinatus and
teres minor muscles. Integrity of the supraspinatus tendon repair icannot be
conclusively assessed by CT, but no gross tendon retraction is appreciated.

The AC joint remains congruent. There is severe osteopenia involving multiple
ribs, with an ununited fracture seen anterolaterally (3:95).  This likely
corresponds to 1 of the previously identified rib fractures. No acute
superimposed rib fractures are identified.

Incidental note is made of coronary artery calcifications and ?  coronary

FINDINGS: 

CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST:
There is continued severe, diffuse effacement of the sulci and lateral
ventricles. While there is a diffuse cerebral swelling, gray-white matter
differentiation remains somewhat preserved.  The basilar cisterns are
increasingly effaced consistent with worsening descending transtentorial
herniation.  Tonsillar herniation is increased.  Left frontal lobe
intraparenchymal hemorrhage is increased.  Right occipital lobe
intraparenchymal hemorrhage has increased.  Bilateral extra-axial hematomas
including an epidural hematoma in the right temporoparietal region and an
epidural or subdural hematoma in the left frontal region are unchanged in
size.  Scattered subarachnoid hemorrhage is not appreciably changed.  A small
amount of intraventricular hemorrhage is unchanged to minimally increased.

Extensive calvarial, skullbase, and facial bone fractures are again seen and
better appreciated on noncontrast head CT 1 day prior.  There is small amount
of underlying pneumocephalus.  These fractures cross the superior sagittal
sinus, though no definite epidural hematoma underlying the superior sagittal
sinus is seen.  A skullbase fracture traverses the left carotid canal. There
is blood with air-fluid levels in the bilateral maxillary sinuses.  Additional
fluid fills the sphenoid sinus and partially opacifies the ethmoid air cells. 
There is diffuse fat stranding throughout the soft tissues of the face.  There
is postseptal subcutaneous emphysema.

CTA HEAD:
The left internal carotid artery demonstrates central hypoattenuation
beginning at about the level of C2 with complete occlusion inferior to the
level of the carotid canal.  This suggests an intraluminal filling defect,
perhaps related to dissection or as a consequence of distal thrombosis. 
Contrast opacification of the right internal carotid artery begins to taper at
the level of the cavernous carotid segment with no flow seen in the
supraclinoid segment.  The bilateral vertebral arteries are well opacified in
the neck but demonstrate no intracranial flow..

Near the vertex, a 4 mm osseous fragment is seen intracranially (601:23). 
Several other ossific densities near the vertex likely represent calcification
of the falx.  A comminuted fracture of the right occiput is mildly displaced. 
Minimally displaced fractures of right orbital medial wall, orbital roof, and
lateral wall are present.  A right zygomatic arch fracture is nondisplaced. 
Minimally displaced fractures of the left orbital roof and medial wall are

the left sphenoid wing and left internal carotid canal (03:18, 03:13).  There
is expected pneumocephalus.

A right convexity extra-axial hematoma measures 8 mm maximally and layers
along the tentorium.  A left temporal subdural hematoma measures 5 mm
maximally.  Adjacent to a left frontal fracture, focus of hemorrhage may be
subarachnoid or represent intraparenchymal hematoma.  Bifrontal and right
parietal subarachnoid hemorrhage are present.  Focus of hyperdensity posterior
to the cervical spine near the craniocervical junction measures 5 mm (2:2).

There is approximately 3 mm of leftward shift of midline structures.  There is
diffuse intracranial edema.  The ventricles are slit-like consistent with
mass-effect.  The basal cisterns are completely effaced consistent with
herniation.

FINDINGS: 

A hyperdense focus in the parenchyma of the right frontal lobe has perhaps
slightly increased in size in the interim, measuring up to is 6.9 mm (Series
2, image 19).  A portion of this is definitely calcified.  The findings
suggest an occult vascular malformation with an uncertain indication of a
possible small component of acute hemorrhage. If this is an occult vascular
malformation, the diagnosis could be confirmed with an MR examination.  There
is no evidence of new hemorrhage.  No evidence of infarction or mass effect. 
The ventricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration.

Ill-defined hypodense left occipital lesions with scattered areas of
hyperdensity correspond to heterogeneously enhancing hemorrhagic lesions as
seen on the recent prior MR examination.  The largest of these lesions
measures approximately 39 x 26 mm (03:22), with another lesion seen
superomedially measuring at least 17 x 12 mm (03:27).  Known small right
temporal, right occipital and bifrontal enhancing lesions are not well
identified on CT.  Confluent areas of left-greater-than-right hemispheric
white matter hypodensity likely represent a combination of edema and
posttreatment change.  There is associated effacement of the occipital horn of
the left lateral ventricle.

No other areas of hemorrhage are seen.  There is no acute large vascular
territorial infarct.  There is moderate prominence of the ventricles and sulci
suggestive of involutional change, unchanged.

There is near complete opacification of the bilateral frontal sinuses,
moderate right and mild left ethmoid mucosal thickening, mild bilateral
sphenoid mucosal thickening and mild left-greater-than-right maxillary sinus
mucosal wall thickening.  There is near complete opacification of the
left-sided mastoid air cells and middle ear cavity and partial opacification
of the right mastoid air cells the visualized portion of the orbits are
unremarkable.

bilateral vertebral arteries producing moderate narrowing on the right and
severe narrowing on the left.  There is a right dominant vertebrobasilar
system.  There are concentric atherosclerotic calcifications of the bilateral
intracranial internal carotid arteries producing mild narrowing.  Posterior
communicating arteries are noted.  The vessels of the circle of ___ and
their principal intracranial branches otherwise appear patent without
occlusion, or aneurysm formation.  The dural venous sinuses are patent.

CTA NECK:
There is moderate atherosclerotic calcification of a 3 vessel aortic arch. 
Scattered calcifications are seen throughout the proximal great vessels
without significant narrowing.  As mild narrowing at the origin of the right
vertebral artery secondary to atherosclerotic calcification.  The left
vertebral artery appears hypoplastic.  There is moderate calcified and
noncalcified atherosclerotic plaque at the bilateral carotid bifurcations
producing roughly 20% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery by NASCET
criteria and no left internal carotid stenosis by NASCET criteria.  The
carotid and vertebral arteries and their major branches otherwise appear
patent with no evidence of dissection, high-grade stenosis or occlusion.

OTHER:
15 mm spiculated right upper lobe lung nodule appears increased in size
compared to ___ where it measured approximately 10 mm (07:13).

COMPARISON:  None.

FINDINGS: 

There are several sites of acute intracranial hemorrhage.  There are multiple
areas of subarachnoid hemorrhage predominantly in the left cerebral
hemisphere, concentrated in the left temporoparietal region (for example see
series 2, image 17).  Smaller foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage and/or cortical
hemorrhage are seen near the vertex (series 2, image 25).  There is a small
focus of intraparenchymal hematoma in the region of the right putaminal
(series 2, image 15).  Additionally, there is intraventricular hemorrhage in
the body of the right lateral ventricle (series 2, image 18).  A focus of
hemorrhage in the septum pellucidum (series 2, image 17) is also noted.  The
above described hemorrhages are similar appearance to outside hospital
examination of ___.

Hyperdensity along the inferior aspect of the left temporal lobe (601 B, image
62 and series 2, image 10) appears to be subdural and appears to be contiguous
with a left tentorial collection, although there also appears to be a
parenchymal component.  This is substantially increased in size when compared
to outside hospital examination.  Finally, there is suggestion of small,
bilateral near isodense extra-axial fluid collections, compatible with
subdural hematomas, new from outside hospital examination.

There is preservation of gray-white matter differentiation.  There is no mass
effect.  The ventricles and sulci are normal in caliber and configuration. 
The visualized paranasal sinuses mastoid air cells are clear.  There is a 6 mm
thick subgaleal hematoma centered over the right parietal bone without
underlying fracture.

Minimal air is seen in the left middle cranial fossa an within the left
carotid canal.  As there is no evidence of calvarial fracture, this likely
represents iatrogenically introduced venous air.

Nondisplaced right zygomatic arch fracture is identified (series 3, image 83).
There is a nasal septal perforation.

The globes and bony orbits are intact and unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:


1. Multiple areas of intracranial hemorrhage.  Specifically, there are
multiple foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage, a small right putaminal
intraparenchymal hematoma, intraventricular hemorrhage, small foci of cortical
hemorrhage near the vertex.  These appear similar in size when compared to
prior exam.
2. Hyperdensity of the left inferior temporal lobe, which may represent a
combination of subdural and parenchymal hematoma.  This is significantly
larger when compared to outside hospital examination of ___.  There
also bilateral subdural hematomas, more prominent when compared to outside
examination.
3. There appears to be a non displaced partially imaged right zygomatic arch
fracture.
4. No significant mass-effect.  No evidence of infarction.
5. Subgaleal hematoma right parietal bone without underlying fracture.
6. Foci of gas is seen in the left middle cranial fossa and at the level of
the left optic canal.  Given that there is no evidence for displaced calvarial
fracture, this likely represents iatrogenically introduced venous air.

FINDINGS: 

CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST:
There is multi focal subarachnoid hemorrhage, predominantly along the
frontoparietal convexities, better visualized on the current study.  In
addition, grossly stable multi focal intraparenchymal hematomas with mild
surrounding edema are seen, predominantly in the bifrontal lobes and left
temporal lobe with layering fluid fluid levels noted, particularly in the
right frontal lobe.  In addition, a small intraparenchymal hematoma is noted
in the right posterior temporal/occipital lobe with a stable larger
intraparenchymal hematoma in the right cerebellum.  Stable bifrontal subdural
hematomas, extending along the interhemispheric fissure and the tentorium are
noted.  There is stable intraventricular hemorrhage in the third and fourth
ventricle with layering hemorrhage in the occipital horns.  Grossly stable
tonsillar herniation is noted.  Stable mild left uncal herniation is also
seen.  Stable 6 mm of left-to-right subfalcine herniation is seen with
effacement of the left frontal horn and to a lesser extent of the right
frontal horn.

There is a stable nondisplaced fracture through the left frontoparietal
calvarium.  In addition, there is a fracture through the posterior right
temporal calvarium extending into the Lambdoid suture with minimal diastasis. 
The fracture lucency does appear to abut the right diminutive sigmoid sinus
and jugular foramen (series 5, image 240).

The visualized portion of the  mastoid air cells, and middle ear cavities are
clear. The visualized portion of the orbits are unremarkable.  Air-fluid
levels with almost complete opacification of the bilateral maxillary sinuses
is seen.  There is partial opacification of the frontal, sphenoid and ethmoid
sinuses.  Fluid is seen layering in the posterior nasopharynx, likely
secondary to intubated status.  The nasal septum is deviated to the right with
a nasal spur seen.  There is apparent fatty replacement of the left parotid
gland.

CTA HEAD:  There is mild atherosclerotic calcification of the cavernous
internal carotid arteries.  The bilateral middle and anterior cerebral
arteries and associated branches are diminutive in caliber.  Otherwise, there
is no evidence ofaneurysm formation. The dural venous sinuses are poorly
visualized due to contrast bolus timing.  The right transverse and sigmoid
sinus as well as jugular foramen are congenitally diminutive without
postcontrast filling although the right proximal internal jugular vein does
appear to opacify.  It is uncertain whether this lack of filling is secondary
to a combination of contrast bolus and diminutive size versus possible subtle
thrombus secondary to adjacent fractures.

CTA NECK:  There is mild atherosclerotic calcification of the aortic arch. 
There is atherosclerotic calcification of the carotid bulbs.  There is
scattered atherosclerotic calcification of the proximal vertebral artery and
throughout the course of the right vertebral artery.  There is approximately
30% stenosis of the proximal left internal carotid artery by NASCET criteria. 
Otherwise, the remainder of the carotid and vertebral arteries and their major
branches appear normal with no evidence of stenosis or occlusion.

OTHER:
Paraseptal emphysema is noted in the bilateral lung apices, right greater than
left.  An endotracheal tube and orogastric tube are partially visualized.  The
visualized portion of the thyroid gland is within normal limits. There is no
lymphadenopathy by CT size criteria.

IMPRESSION:


1. Multifocal subarachnoid, subdural and intraparenchymal hematomas, as
described above with mild left uncal herniation, stable left to right
subfalcine herniation and tonsillar herniation.
2. Mild narrowing of the anterior and middle cerebral arteries and branches,
likely secondary to vasospasm.
3. The right transverse and sigmoid sinus as well as jugular foramen are
congenitally diminutive without postcontrast filling although the right
proximal internal jugular vein does appear to opacify.  It is uncertain
whether this lack of filling is secondary to a combination of contrast bolus
timing and diminutive size versus possible subtle nonocclusive thrombus
secondary to adjacent fractures.  If clinically indicated, repeat CTV could be
performed.
4. 30% stenosis of the proximal left internal carotid artery by NASCET
criteria.
5. No evidence of aneurysm, vascular abnormality or thrombosis.

FINDINGS: 

Intracranial pressure bolt placement in the right frontal cortex appears
unchanged in position.  Study is limited by streak artifact from this device.

Intraparenchymal hemorrhage in both frontal lobes, left temporal lobe, and
right parietal lobe, and right cerebellum are similar in size from the prior
study although there may be minimal increased surrounding cytotoxic edema of
the left frontal lobe and left anterior temporal lobe.  Mass effect on the
left lateral ventricle with 4 mm left-to-right midline shift is unchanged. 
There remains mild left uncal herniation and inferior cerebellar tonsillar
displacement.

Epidural hemorrhage along the tentorium is unchanged.  Diffuse subarachnoid
hemorrhage appears similar.

Nondisplaced fracture through the left frontoparietal bone and minimal
diastases of the right temple bone are unchanged.

Again seen is hyperdense fluid in the maxillary sinuses, likely blood products
in the setting of trauma however underlying fungal sinusitis or inspissated
secretions cannot be excluded.  Partial opacification of the ethmoid air
cells, sphenoid sinuses, and frontal sinuses appears unchanged.

The orbits are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:


1. Stable placement of the intracranial pressure bolt overlying the right
frontal lobe all with streak artifact from device limiting examination.
2. Multifocal intraparenchymal hemorrhage, intraventricular hemorrhage, and
diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage are essentially unchanged, although there
appears to be minimally increased cytotoxic edema surrounding the hemorrhages

edema extending across the genu corpus callosum with patchy underlying slow
diffusion consistent with diffuse axonal injury.  There is hemorrhagic
cortical contusion at the right temporoparietal cortex (___).

There is a large hemorrhagic contusion at the right cerebellar hemisphere with
significant adjacent vasogenic edema causing mass effect which effaces the
fourth ventricle and displaces the midbrain to the left.  There is a large
hemorrhagic cortical contusion at the anterior left temporal cortex.  There is
a small hemorrhagic contusion at the anterior right temporal cortex.

There is slow diffusion in the anterior left cingulate gyrus with gyriform
enhancement most likely due to a new subacute infarction. There are similar
small lesion involving the bilateral temporoparietal and left occipital
hemispheres with associated FLAIR hyperintensity and no evidence hemorrhage. 
It is possible that some of these areas of slow diffusion and enhancement
reflect a direct consequences of severe injury including cortical contusions
rather than infarction.

There is left uncal herniation, which compresses the left cerebellar peduncle.
There is 4 mm of left to right subfalcine herniation.  The frontal hemorrhagic
contusions produces severe bifrontal mass effect and brain compression There
is a small amount of blood layering within the occipital horn lateral

COMPARISONS:  None.

TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial MDCT images were obtained through the chest
without the administration of IV contrast.  Sagittal, coronal, and axial
maximum intensity projection reformatted images were obtained and reviewed.

FINDINGS:  The imaged portions of the thyroid gland are normal.  There is no
axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy.

The heart is moderately enlarged.  A small pericardial effusion is
physiologic.  There are severe atherosclerotic calcifications along the
coronary arteries, moderate calcification along the mitral annulus, and ___
calcifications of the aortic valve, in keeping with the history of aortic
stenosis.  The main pulmonary artery trunk is normal in size.

There are thin mild atherosclerotic calcifications along the ascending aorta. 
Starting at the takeoff of the right coronary artery and extending superiorly
for approximately 3.8 cm, the majority of the atherosclerotic calcifications
are on the posterior and left lateral aspects of the aorta.  In this segment,
the anterior and right lateral aspects of the ascending aorta are mostly
spared of calcifications.  In the distal ascending aorta, the calcifications
are present along the posterior aspect of the aorta; the anterior, right
lateral, and left lateral aspects are mostly clear.  Extending from the arch
through the entire visualized portions of the descending aorta, there are
heavy nearly circumferential calcifications.

The ascending aorta is normal in caliber, measuring 36 mm in its maximal
dimension with a normal physiologic taper.  In the mid arch, there is a very
mild fusiform ectasia measuring 29 mm (2, 22).  Additionally, in the
descending aorta, there is a short segment of minimal fusiform dilatation at
the level of the base of the heart measuring 29 mm (2, 48).  In the most
inferior image of the abdominal aorta, the aorta is either starting to become
tortuous and take a turn or mildly dilated.  It is incompletely imaged.

Moderate atherosclerotic calcifications are noted at the takeoff of the
branches of the aortic arch.  Additionally, dense atherosclerotic
calcifications are noted along the splenic artery.

The airways are patent to the subsegmental levels.  There is minimal scarring
along the right major fissure.  Minimal atelectasis is noted along the left
major fissure and left base.  There is no emphysema, bronchiectasis, fibrosis,
or pulmonary edema.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

At the right base, there is a 9 x 12 mm pulmonary nodule (4, 166).  No other
discrete pulmonary nodules are identified.

There is severe kyphosis with associated degenerative changes at the spine,
including a large osteophyte at the level of L3 which is impinging into the
spinal canal causing severe narrowing.  Multiple old healed rib fractures are
noted in the left upper posterior ribs.  Degenerative changes with calcific
tendinitis are noted in the bilateral shoulders.

This exam is not tailored to evaluate the subdiaphragmatic structures.  Within
the limitations, a small amount of pneumobilia is present, likely from the
prior hepatojejunostomy.  The imaged portions of the spleen, pancreas, and
adrenal glands are normal.

2.  Mild atherosclerotic calcifications of the ascending aorta, as described
above.  Severe calcifications of the descending aorta.  Mild fusiform ectasia
is noted in the aortic arch and the descending aorta.  The abdominal aorta is
partially imaged, though an abdominal aortic aneurysm may be present given
mild dilation in the most inferior image of the exam.  If clinically
indicated, this could evaluate with a CT or ultrasound of the abdomen.

COMPARISON:  CT abdomen and pelvis from ___.

FINDINGS:

MRI abdomen with and without contrast:  The bases of the lungs are clear. 
There is a trace pleural effusion on the left.  There is moderate intermittent
stricturing and dilatation of the entire intrahepatic bile duct system of the
right and left lobes (9:1).  There are small areas with signal characteristics
of fibrosis.  On the postcontrast images, there are areas of peribiliary early
hyperenhancement consistent with acute inflammation as well as areas of
delayed enhancement reflecting chronic inflammation.  The vessels in segments
II and III extend to the capsule as can be seen in chronic sclerosing
cholangitis.  The overall biliary appearance is suggestive of sequelae of
cholangitis either chronic cholangitis or primary sclerosing cholangitis.  The
portal vein is patent.  The patient is status post cholecystectomy and
hepaticojejunostomy.

The pancreas is normal in signal intensity and enhances homogeneously.  The
pancreatic duct is mildly irregular with multiple visible side branches. 
There are multiple cystic lesions in the pancreatic tail, one in the medial
aspect of the tail measuring 1.7 cm and one in the lateral aspect measuring
1.4 cm.  The appearance of the pancreas could represent sequela of prior
pancreatitis as well as IPMNs.  The spleen and adrenal glands are
unremarkable.  The kidneys demonstrate numerous tiny simple appearing cysts
bilaterally.  The visualized small and large bowel loops are unremarkable.  No
oral retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy is present.  The
intra-abdominal aorta demonstrates atherosclerotic calcifications.  There is a
3.1 cm infrarenal aortic aneurysm which has increased slightly from ___ when
it measured 2.4 cm.

Bone marrow signal is normal.  S-shaped scoliosis is unchanged as are
multilevel degenerative changes.  A subchondral cyst is seen in the right
femoral head.


IMPRESSION:
1. Appearance of the intrahepatic bile ducts are consistent with acute on
chronic inflammation suggestive of sequela of cholangitis either infectious
cholangitis or sclerosing cholangitis.

CT CHEST:

Substantial bursitis of the right shoulder was demonstrated, with multiple
potentially enhancing loculations of fluid, partially imaged on the prior
study.  The patient cannot raise her shoulder.  No mediastinal, hilar, or
axillary lymph nodes present.  Pulmonary arteries are dilated consistent with
pulmonary hypertension potentially.  Small bilateral pleural effusion is
present.  Cardiomegaly is present.

The airways are patent till the subsegmental level bilaterally.  Endobronchial
secretions are noted in the right upper lobe posterior segment bronchus,
grossly unchanged since the prior examination.  Right lower lobe nodule, 8:104
is lobulated, approaching 1 cm in diameter.  When compared to the prior study
from ___, demonstrates no evidence of internal change in this
short-term interval.  Scarring in the left lower lobe and lingula is unchanged
as well.  No new nodules, masses, or consolidations demonstrated.

CT ABDOMEN:

The patient is after most likely sphincterotomy and cholecystectomy that
explain her pneumobilia.  The spleen is unremarkable.  Adrenals, kidneys are
within normal limits.  Hypodensities in the kidneys are noted, too small to
characterize, most likely representing cysts.  Within the tail of the
pancreas, there are multiple hypodensities and potentially some dilatation of
the pancreatic duct, although no obstructing mass clearly seen.  Normal
appendix is present.

CT PELVIS:

There is no evidence of dilatation of the bowel.  Note is made that the
assessment of the pelvis is very difficult due to multiple artifacts from left
total knee replacement.  Diverticulosis is present but no evidence of
diverticulitis.

Assessment of the aorta and iliac arteries demonstrate extensive calcification
but relatively wide diameter.  No evidence of occlusion demonstrated within
the left iliofemoral tree.  Within the abdomen, there is a dilatation of the
abdominal aorta up to 2.5 x 2.9 cm consistent with pre-aneurysm dilatation. 
Ectasia of the thoracic aorta is present but no evidence of aneurysm is seen. 
The measurements regarding subclavian arteries and iliofemoral bypass as well
as aortic valve will be provided separately.

There are extensive degenerative changes involving the thoracic spine, lumbar
spine and mild compression fractures of the cervical spine.  No lytic or

FINDINGS: 

There is an area of mild hyperdensity in the right parietal lobe measuring
approximately 13 mm in diameter.  This is surrounded by vasogenic edema. 
Although this could be a consequence of a subacute hemorrhage, the subcortical
and white matter location, rather than cortical center, argues against a
hemorrhagic contusion.  The appearance would be more concerning for a
neoplasm.  The mild hyperdensity would suggest lymphoma, but metastasis or
glioblastoma could present a similar appearance.  An abscess would be
plausible, but these are usually not hyperdense on noncontrast CT.  This would
be best evaluated with an MR scan without and with contrast.  If the patient
cannot undergo MR imaging, than a head CT contrast would be helpful

No other lesions are detected.  There is mild prominence of the ventricles and
sulci in an atrophic pattern.
There is no evidence of fracture.  Right supraorbital scalp swelling is noted.

for lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly.

EXAMINATION:  CT of the abdomen and pelvis using a general abdomen and pelvis
protocol.

COMPARISONS:  Comparison to CT of the chest from ___ and CT of the chest
from ___.

TECHNIQUE:  MDCT-acquired axial images from the lung bases to the pubic
symphysis were obtained after the administration of oral and Optiray 350
intravenous contrast using a general abdomen and pelvis protocol.  Coronal and
sagittal reformations were performed.

FINDINGS:

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:

There has been interval development of ground-glass opacity and airspace
consolidation within the right lower lobe at the right base with centrilobular
consolidation at the left base that is concerning for a developing right
greater than left lower lobe pneumonia.  Peribronchial thickening is also new
in the interval within the involved lung and is more marked on the right.
Aspiration is also in the differential diagnosis. Within the left lower lobe
there is a subpleural nodule best seen on (3:7) that is stable in appearance
from remote study from ___.  No pleural effusions are seen.

The patient is status post cholecystectomy.  The liver is normal in
appearance.  There is prominence of the common bile duct with prominence at
the ductal insertion at the ampulla which measures approximately 8 mm which
where the differential diagnosis includes a choledochocele or prominence of
the papilla at this level, however, an ampullary mass cannot be excluded.  The
spleen measures 12 cm that is consistent with borderline splenomegaly.  The
pancreas, both adrenal glands, small and large bowel are normal.  There is no
mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  There is no abdominal free
fluid or free air.  Within the interpole of the left kidney, there is a 2.2 cm
round well-circumscribed lesion measuring fluid density that has
characteristics consistent with a simple cyst.  There is a 1.1-cm simple cyst
in the interpole of the right kidney.  There are multiple too small to
characterize hypodensities within both kidneys best seen (3:28) in the right
kidney upper pole and (3:38) in the left kidney lower pole that are too small
to characterize, however, likely represent simple cysts.  Both ureters are
normal.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The sigmoid colon demonstrates
multiple diverticuli  consistent with diverticulosis.  On image (3:65) there
is a round structure associated with the mid sigmoid colon that likely
represents a prominent mucosal fold, recommend correlation with recent
colonoscopy.  The rectum, uterus, bladder and left adnexa are normal. Adjacent
to the right ovary (3:69) there is an oblong lesion measuring 1.6 cm that
measures mainly fluid density, that could represent a paraovarian cyst,
however, a cystic lesion of the ovary cannot be excluded. In addition this
lesion best seen on sagittal reformations on (7:482) is just posterior to a
segment of sigmoid colon,  and origination from colon cannot be entirely
excluded.  There is no pelvic free fluid and no pelvic or inguinal
lymphadenopathy.

BONE WINDOWS:  There are severe multilevel degenerative changes with
malalignment noted at the L3-L4 vertebral bodies with loss of disc height
throughout the lumbar and thoracic spines and loss of disc height throughout
the lumbar, thoracic spines.  There is joint space narrowing and sclerosis at
both hip joints.

IMPRESSION:
1.  Borderline splenomegaly.  No lymphadenopathy.

2.  Bilateral lower lobe pneumonia or aspiration, more marked on the right.
Follow up after treatment is recommended to ensure resolution.

3.  Prominence of the biliary duct at its origin at the ampulla.  This could
represent physiologic prominence of the duct, or a choledochocele.  A small
ampullary mass cannot be entirely excluded. ERCP could be obtained for further
evaluation if indicated. 

4.  Cystic lesion adjacent to the right ovary that could either be paraovarian
or ovarian in nature.  Enteric duplication cyst felt much less likely.
Recommend pelvic ultrasound for further evaluation.

5.  Mid sigmoid colon hypodensity that likely represents a prominent mucosal
fold, recommend correlation with patient's recent colonoscopies.

6.  Severe multilevel thoracolumbar spine degenerative changes with
malalignment at the L3- L4 level.
